"""`examples/` and the sector policy templates. Build-list item 2; SPEC-v0.2 §1.1, T31.

Two halves of one promise. The scripts each run the failure they exist to demonstrate and
print the refusal, with no network and a state directory of their own. The templates are
starting points on the v0.1 kernel — which is what lets this item land before §3 changes the
policy schema — so every one declares `ctrlrun.policy/v1` and uses no key §3 adds.

The network is not taken on trust: each script runs in a subprocess whose `sitecustomize`
refuses every socket, so an example that grew a dependency on a live service fails here
rather than on the reader's laptop.

    **Both halves or neither.** An example that only showed the anchor catching a truncation
    would be an advertisement: the reader has to see that the chain alone reports the same store
    intact, or the anchor is solving a problem they have no reason to believe in.

    **And it must not overclaim.** This is the first thing in this project a reader could mistake
    for tamper-proofing, so the script prints what an anchor does *not* prove as plainly as what
    it does, and this asserts those lines. `CLAIMS.md` uses the same shape: "there is no such
    claim" is a statement about the environment until something checks it.
