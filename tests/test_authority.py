"""The `authority:` section, grants and evaluation. Build-list item 2; SPEC-v0.3 §4.

The acceptance tests are T66 to T74b. Four sentences run through all of them:

**Authority is opt-in, then fail-closed** (§4.1). No `authority:` key at all is v0.2, exactly —
T66 — and the moment one exists every principal needs a grant, including for actions the policy
allows outright.

**A grant carries no decision** (§4.2). Authority answers "may this principal do this at all";
policy answers "how much autonomy does the action have". So T70 is a 2-by-3 whose bottom
row collapses to one case, not the 3-by-3 the build brief asked for.

**Authority runs before policy** (§4.3). A denial there must not leave a pending approval
request behind, so T74 asserts the trace and not merely the outcome.

**The reason is asserted by name, everywhere** (§4.3). A guard that can only fire where a later
guard would also fire, with the same observable result, is documentation rather than defence;
a test asserting only "it was refused" cannot tell which check ran.
