**This suite is written before the implementation and is expected to be red.** It is the
specification in executable form: `docs/SPEC-scan.md` says what the command does, and every
test here names the section it enforces. Making it green is the item; nothing in it should be
weakened to get there.

Each test imports `ctrlrun.scan` inside its own body rather than at module scope, so that a
