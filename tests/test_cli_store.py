"""How the read commands open a store, and what they say when they cannot.

`_store`'s docstring states the invariant: *"It creates nothing, and it migrates nothing -- a
command an operator runs to read evidence must not have a side effect on the database it
reads."* The explicit `sqlite://` branch held to it; the default branch did not, so
`ctrlrun receipts` in any directory without a `ctrlrun.yaml` created a state database, migrated
it, and answered "no receipts yet" -- an operator looking for evidence of an agent action was
told there was none, from a store they had just created one directory away.

And five commands called `_store` outside the `try` that turns a kernel refusal into a clean
message, so every refusal it raises reached the terminal as a traceback. `ctrlrun effects`,
which calls it inside, printed one clean line for the identical input.
