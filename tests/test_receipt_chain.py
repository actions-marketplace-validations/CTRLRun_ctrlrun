"""Receipt integrity. Build-list item 6; SPEC-v0.6 §6, §8 T164-T170.

**The tamper test is the deliverable and it is written first** (§6.5). Everything else in this
file exists to stop that test lying: the positive control that an untampered chain verifies, the
`seq`-inside-the-content case that justifies the design, and the corpus proving the promotion of
`canonical_bytes` moved no hash that already exists.

What the chain does **not** cover is in §6.4 and is repeated wherever it is described. It is not
authorship, not a signature, not a defence against somebody who can rewrite every row including
the head, and not evidence that every action wrote a receipt.
