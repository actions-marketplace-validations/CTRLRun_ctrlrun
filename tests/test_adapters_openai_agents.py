"""The OpenAI Agents SDK reference adapter. SPEC-v0.5 §3.5, §6, §7; T135, T135b, T137.

Every test here drives a **real `Runner`** with a real `function_tool`, a real
`needs_approval` predicate, a real `ToolApprovalItem` and a real `state.approve(...)`. What is
not real is the model: a deterministic `FakeModel` emits one tool call and then one message, so
the run is exactly reproducible and costs nothing.

That is legitimate here in a way it would not be in `research/framework-probe/`. The probe
measures *a framework's* behaviour and its fairness rules demand framework defaults and a real
model; this measures *the adapter*, and what a model would have decided is not the subject.
The framework's own approval machinery is exercised in full either way.

Skipped **by name** where `openai-agents` is not installed.

    call raises `NotExecuted`, and the executor re-raises its own error from it. The kernel is
    correct throughout -- the audit effect is FAILED, the refund is AMBIGUOUS -- and `unwrap`
    handed the caller `NotExecuted`, whose entire contract is *definitely did not run, safe to
    retry*. An agent acting on that retries a refund that may already have landed, which is the
    one thing `v0.1 §5.5` exists to prevent.

    So the walk descends only through the SDK's own wrappers and stops at the first thing that
    is not one, whatever type that is.

    """SPEC-v0.5 §3.6 and `v0.3 §6.2`. Found by item 6, from the contract alone.

    §3.6's rule is *an adapter never interrupts in observe mode*, and its argument runs through
    `Control.execute`: `ApprovalRequired` is never raised there, so `wait()` is never called and
    the primitive is never reached. That argument holds for the resumed-in-place shape and not
    for this one. Here the primitive is reached from the **predicate**, one step earlier, and
    `ctrlrun.adapter.needs_approval` is `Control.evaluate` -- which `v0.3 §6.2` says evaluates
    identically under observe mode. So the gate returned `True`, the SDK stopped the run, and a
    human was asked.

    The consequence is worse than the rule it breaks: a framework of this shape does not invoke
    a tool whose approval was declined, so a human's *no* under `mode: observe` **stops the
    action** -- and observe mode's whole promise is that every decision is recorded and none is
    enforced. A deployment evaluating ctrlrun in the mode built for evaluating it had its agent
    halted.
