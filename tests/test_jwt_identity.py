"""`JWTIdentityProvider`. Build-list item 5; SPEC-v0.3 §3.4.

The acceptance tests are T88, T88b, T89, T90 and T92. Keys are generated in the test and
nothing reaches the network: the JWKS is served from a fixture that counts its fetches, and
the static-key cases assert no outbound connection is attempted.

Three sentences run through all of them:

**Identity is consumed, never invented.** The provider verifies a token somebody else issued
and maps the verified claims onto a `Principal`. It mints nothing, and the two limits it
cannot work around — an exact `issuer` and no revocation channel — are stated rather than
configured around.

**Configuration is refused before any token is seen** (T88b). Key confusion has a
configuration end and a token end; the token end is already covered by the `algorithms`
allow-list, so a test that only exercised it would prove nothing the library was not already
doing. T88b is the configuration end.

**Every refusal is asserted by cause** (T89). Twelve ways a token can be wrong all raise
`IdentityError` with a message that tells a client nothing, so a test asserting only the type
cannot tell twelve guards apart. Each case here asserts a distinguishing observable: the log
the provider wrote, and a fetch or upstream count of zero.
