"""Observe mode and `ctrlrun stats`. Build-list item 4; SPEC-v0.3 §6.

The acceptance tests are T82 to T87. Four sentences run through all of them:

**Everything is evaluated, nothing about an action is enforced, everything is recorded**
(§6.2). T82 asserts both halves in one test, so "observe executes" cannot pass by the action
having been allowed.

**Observe mode is not a dry run** (§6.6). It executes, effects land at remotes, and the
records of them are real — which is why T83 asserts that a *refused* reservation writes no
effect record, and why T87 asserts the store survives the switch to enforce untouched.

**There is one switch and it governs the process** (§6.1). A `mode:` anywhere but the top
level is a load error naming the path, and T84 walks every nesting the document has.

**A rollout mode that pages a human is a queue that fills up** (§6.2). T82c asserts the
absence of the request, the absence of the event, and the executor having run anyway.
