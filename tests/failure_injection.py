"""A Postgres connection an experiment can break on purpose. Build-list item 4; SPEC-v0.6 §4.5.

Test infrastructure. It is never in the wheel -- `pyproject.toml`'s `packages.find` is `src/`
only -- and it *is* in the sdist, because `MANIFEST.in`'s `recursive-include tests *.py` puts
every test file there, which is correct and true of all of them.

**Why a proxy and not a container.** §4.5's most important test is *the connection dies during
`COMMIT`* -- the case where a naive port reports `FAILED` for an effect that committed. Killing a
container reproduces that only if the timing happens to land there; a proxy that forwards the
`COMMIT` to the server and *then* drops the client reproduces it every time, which is what
"opens its window on purpose" means, and this project's standing rule is that a test which
"usually" reproduces an interleaving proves nothing about the run where it did not.

What a proxy cannot do is put the two ends on different hosts. §4.5 asks for that separately and
the PR says which was run.

**The frontend protocol is parsed, not grepped.** The first version triggered on
`b"COMMIT" in data`, which fires on any chunk in the client-to-server direction carrying those
six bytes -- including a Bind message whose *parameter* is an effect key containing the word. An
independent review demonstrated it: a key named `refund:COMMIT-me` killed the client on the
`SELECT`'s Bind, which is §4.3's Table A row 1 (an exception *before* `COMMIT`, a clean `FAILED`)
and not the ambiguous window at all -- and `clients_killed >= 1`, the guard added specifically to
catch that class of false green, still passed. `_Frontend` below reads the length-prefixed
messages properly, so a `COMMIT` means the simple-Query message `COMMIT`.

class Proxy:
    """A TCP relay in front of Postgres, with a switch for each way it can break.

    Four modes, each named for the row of §4.3's Table A it produces, and a fifth, `arm()`, which
    produces none and opens a window instead (SPEC-v0.7 §5.6):

    - `kill_on_commit` -- forward the `COMMIT` to the server, let it land, then drop the client.
      The server very likely committed and the client will never know: **ambiguous**, and the
      re-read finds the write already there (Table A1 row 1 / A2 row 1).
    - `drop_before_commit` -- an integer: swallow the next N `COMMIT`s and drop the client each
      time, **without** forwarding them. Equally ambiguous from the client's side, and the write
      is *not* there: this is what drives A1's "no record → retry the insert" and A2's "unchanged
      → re-issue", the two rows nothing reached before. A count rather than a flag
      because those rows *re-issue* -- a flag would swallow the retry's `COMMIT` too, and the test
      could never observe the row completing. Set it high to drive the unbounded case instead.
    - `refuse_connections` -- accept and immediately close. The client's first `recv` returns
      `b""`: an orderly close, not an `ECONNREFUSED` and not a reset either. A store's re-read
      then fails, which §4.3.2 says must refuse to let execution proceed rather than guess.
    - `partition` -- **hold** traffic in both directions rather than discarding it, and release it
      through the same path it would have taken live, so the frame parser stays aligned. The
      client sees a stall, not a reset, and `partition = False` genuinely restores the connection,
      which is §4.5's "and restore it". Discarding instead would make the restore unexercisable:
      the query the server never received cannot arrive late.
    - `arm(predicate)` -- a predicate over each parsed client message, `(type, body)`. The first
      message it accepts is **held**: the chunk carrying it is not forwarded, `holding` is set,
      and the pump waits for `release()`. One statement on one connection, where `partition`
      stops every connection at once. It is what opens a window *inside* a store method, between
      one statement and the next, which SPEC-v0.7 §5.6's windows need and nothing else here could
      reach: the statements before it have run, the held one has not, and every other connection
      carries on. It fires once and disarms; `arm()` again for the next window, which it refuses
      while one is armed or held. The chunk is held whole, which for a client that waits for each
      statement's reply before sending the next (psycopg does) is the held statement's own
      Parse/Bind/Execute/Sync and nothing else.
