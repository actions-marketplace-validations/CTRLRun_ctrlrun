"""The composite action, the badge and `https://ctrlrun.dev/docs/verify`. SPEC-v0.4 §5; T118-T120.

The badge is the shortest sentence this project makes, and the one most likely to be read
without the report behind it. So its text is asserted as a *concatenation* and against a
regex rather than a word list — no adjective can be appended to it later — and the vocabulary
it is not allowed to use is asserted against the badge, the job summary and `https://ctrlrun.dev/docs/verify`
together.

T118's substance runs in this repository's CI, where the action actually executes. What is
asserted here is that the job exists, that it runs the action against both configurations, and
that it checks the two shapes the specification names — because a CI job nothing asserts is a
CI job somebody can delete.
