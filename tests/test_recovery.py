"""Recovery on restart. Build-list item 5; SPEC-v0.6 §5, §8 T159-T163.

What a process finds when it comes back, and what it is allowed to conclude. The answer to the
second question is almost nothing: **"the holder is dead" is not knowable from the store**, and no
amount of schema makes it knowable. What ages a reservation out is its lease, and what an expired
lease produces is `AMBIGUOUS` -- which is a refusal, not a reclaim.
