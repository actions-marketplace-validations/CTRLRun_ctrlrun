"""Attempt numbers never repeat, on Postgres. Item 3a; SPEC-v0.7 §5.6, §8.3a (T246, T246b).

Two properties, and at 0.6.1 neither held on Postgres: **no two reservations of one key carry the
same attempt number**, and **the number a reservation method returns is the number it wrote**.
v0.7 makes the attempt number load-bearing twice, in the idempotency token and in the ceiling, so a
reused number gives two dispatches one token and lets a ceiling of N admit N+1.

**Every window here is opened on purpose** (mutation pattern 4). Two processes renewing
concurrently open none of them: each needs one store stalled at a precise point inside a
reservation method while a second process renews, runs and fails. The proxy the tests own does the
stalling, and it holds one statement on one connection (`failure_injection.Proxy.arm`) or
swallows one `COMMIT` and acts before the re-read (`drop_before_commit`, `on_drop`).

**What was run, stated first, as `test_cross_host.py` does.** The store under test and the store
that interleaves are **separate OS processes**, each with its own connection, against one local
Postgres; the parent owns the proxy and only orchestrates. They are not two hosts. Every wait is
bounded, so a store that never reaches the window fails red rather than hanging.

**SQLite has no row here, and that is not a gap.** Its renewal reads and writes inside one
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, so the stale case is unreachable and the same `AND attempt = ?` is an
equivalent mutant there; it has no lost-commit path at all (§5.6).

    """SPEC-v0.8 §4.3. The window is between the read of `approvers` and the update of it.

    Two OS processes, two distinct verified principals, one request needing two yeses. The proxy
    holds ALICE's `UPDATE` after her connection has already read the row — an empty approver
    list — and BOB's grant lands in that window. When ALICE's update is released it must not
    write the list she read over the one BOB wrote.

    **It fails against a compare-and-set on `status`,** which is the shape the store had and the
    shape a reviewer found: `status` is still `pending` when ALICE's held update lands, so the
    condition holds, her write succeeds, and the row ends with one approver and a threshold of
    two that a third yes would have to fill. Nobody would ever know: two humans answered and the
    record says one did.

    `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s fourth mutation shape is the reason this test exists at all. Item 4's serial
    tests pass against a store with no compare-and-set whatever, because a read and a write with
    nothing in between is correct right up until something *is* in between.

    The round-2 review drove this through the public API on SQLite, so the store is not the
    variable: the executor runs past its lease, a contender finds the lapsed record and makes it
    `AMBIGUOUS`, a human resolves it `FAILED` while the attempt is *still running*, and only then
    does the executor raise `TimeoutError`. `mark_ambiguous` is then refused, because `FAILED` is
    not a state this attempt may move from, and that refusal used to escape `Control`: no receipt,
    no `EXECUTION_AMBIGUOUS` event, and the caller handed an `InvalidArgument` about its own effect
    key instead of the exception its executor raised. An unknown outcome vanished, on both
    backends, and this has nothing to do with the attempt number.

    The store's answer may be a refusal; the evidence may not. The receipt and the event are
    written whatever the store says, they name the refusal, and the caller gets its own exception
    back. What the effect record says afterwards is the human's claim and not this attempt's, which
    is the residual §12.3a states and the reason the receipt has to carry the truth.

    **And the receipt says what the executor did**, which is the fact a human resolving the effect
    needs most. All three outcomes end here: a timeout, an executor that returned normally (so the
    remote very likely acted), and one that raised `NotExecuted` (so it very likely did not). A
    review found the last two producing byte-identical receipts, because the refusal was recorded

    `T155f` is the precedent: the lost-commit re-issue had no bound, and driven with a proxy that
    swallowed every `COMMIT` the store recursed 96 deep and escaped as `RecursionError`, outside
    the error taxonomy entirely. The stale re-issue is bounded the same way, by a flag, and this
    drives it the same way: a record that has moved **again** by the time the re-issue reads it.

    No proxy can open that window deterministically, because it would have to interleave a rival
    inside each re-issue, and a hold fires once. So the seam is the store's own read, subclassed to
    report the record one attempt further on each time it is consulted while the flag is set: a
    rival that never stops moving. It refuses nothing the real store refuses and invents no outcome
    the real store cannot produce, it only makes every conditional `UPDATE` miss, which is what a
    rival moving the row does. With the bound the call refuses; without it, it recurses until
    Python stops it, which is a failure mode no caller can classify.

    """Two bounds that reset each other are one unbounded loop, and this drives both at once.

    `restaged` bounds the stale re-issue; `retrying` bounds the lost-commit re-issue of `v0.6`
    §4.3.2 Table A2. Each was tested alone. A review composed them: a `COMMIT` lost *inside* a
    restage re-entered the lost-commit path, which re-issued without `restaged`, which restaged
    again without `retrying`, and the two alternated to `RecursionError` at 113 deep. That is
    T155f's failure mode exactly, and T155f's comment says why it matters: `RecursionError` is
    outside this library's closed set of errors, so no caller can classify it and the record is
    left stranded.

    Both halves are driven the way each is driven alone. The lost `COMMIT` is the **real** proxy at
    `drop_before_commit = 1000`, which is T155f's injection; the record that keeps moving is the
    bound test's seam, which is what a same-`action_id` renewal leaves behind. Neither invents a
    store answer: one is a connection dying mid-`COMMIT`, the other is a row a rival advanced.

    **The assertion is the nesting, not the absence of a `RecursionError`, and the reason is what a
    search of these interleavings shows.** Dropping *both* flags recurses, on some patterns and not
    others. Dropping *one* does not recurse at all on any pattern of four reads or fewer: it
    permits exactly one re-issue more than the bound allows, which happens to terminate. So a test
    that asked only "did this blow the stack" would be green for half the ways this can break, and
    would have been green for the very mutants that say each flag is load-bearing. Each bound
    permits one re-issue, so the deepest nesting any interleaving may reach is three; a fourth
    level means a bound was cleared, whether or not that particular pattern went on forever. The
    patterns here are the two that separate every case, measured through this proxy rather than
    guessed: both recurse with both flags gone; `(0, 0, 1, 0)` reaches four with the restage's
    `retrying` dropped, and `(1, 0, 0, 0)` reaches four with the lost-commit re-issue's `restaged`
    dropped. Either one alone would leave one of the two flags untested.
