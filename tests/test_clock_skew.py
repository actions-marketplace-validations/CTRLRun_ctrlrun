"""Clock-skew detection. Build-list item 1 of v0.7; SPEC-v0.7 §3, §8.1 T209-T219.

**Item 1 observes and reports. It changes no decision.** Every lease is decided against the
application clock exactly as at 0.6.1 (§3.2), and T213 is the test that says so with skew present.

The injection point is the *application* clock, through `clock=`, and Postgres keeps its own. That
is the honest direction: it is the one an operator's hosts get wrong. The tests that need a server
skip without `CTRLRUN_TEST_POSTGRES`; the arithmetic, the threshold's refusals, `Control`'s handling
of the optional attribute, the conformance case on the two shipped backends and G13's `N/A` all
run without one.
