"""Precondition fingerprints. Build-list item 5; SPEC-v0.7 §6, §7, §8.5 T253-T269.

An approval binds to an `action_hash` and an expiry. It does not bind to the state of the world
it was granted against. A human approves *delete customer C123* when the balance is zero and the
account inactive; thirty minutes later the balance is $50,000 and the account is active. The
action has not changed. The world has.

**The recheck narrows the window between a human's decision and the action's execution; it
does not close it.** It is a network call, so it cannot run inside the atomic reservation write,
and a change that lands after the comparison and before the reservation is not refused. T261b
opens exactly that window and asserts the action is *not* refused, because that is what the
kernel does, and a test that said otherwise would make the documentation false.

Every refusal below asserts its `reason`. A precondition mismatch and an ordinary
`ApprovalMismatch` share a type, and a test that asserted only the type could not tell which
guard fired: the first of the four shapes of a false green in the milestone's plan.

    A float among a receipt's `controls` is a malformed *value* of a key the schema declares. It

    that cannot be canonicalized, so `CHAIN_BREAKS` did not grow and its frozen closed set
    (`SPEC-v0.6 §6.5`) is untouched.
