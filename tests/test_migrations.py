"""Schema version and forward-only migrations. Build-list item 2; SPEC-v0.6 §3, §8 T147-T152b.

Six places across v0.2, v0.3, v0.4 and v0.5 say *"there is still no migration story -- that is
v0.6."* This is it, and it comes **before** Postgres, because adding a second schema before the
versioning exists means two schemas drifting with no marker to tell you.

The v0.5-database test is the one that matters. A fixture written by hand asserts what its author
believed the old schema was; a database built by v0.5's own code asserts what it actually was.
