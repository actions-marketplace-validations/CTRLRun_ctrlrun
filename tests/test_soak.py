"""The soak harness. Item 8; SPEC-v0.6 §8.1.

The harness lives in `research/soak/`, outside `src/` and never packaged — but **its definition
of "unexplained" is the release gate**, so it is tested here rather than trusted. `ROADMAP.md`'s
exit criterion is a published run with no unexplained `AMBIGUOUS` and a positive control that
fired, and a harness that miscounts is a criterion that cannot be met or cannot be failed. §8.1
took a week of calendar time out of that criterion on 2026-09-07 and records why; what the
harness owes it did not change, and got more load-bearing rather than less — the clock is no
longer there to stand in front of the count.

What these assert is the two ways the count can lie:

- **counting an injected ambiguity as unexplained**, which would make the gate unpassable and
  invite somebody to relax it;
- **counting an unexplained one as explained**, which is the failure that matters — it publishes
  a zero that means nothing.

# **The harness is not in the sdist, and this file is.** `MANIFEST.in` ships `tests/*.py` so a

# and the `package` CI job found it: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'soak'`.
#
# The skip is **narrow on purpose**, and the narrowness is the whole argument. It fires only when
# the directory is genuinely absent, and that absence is itself asserted by
# `test_T136_the_ctrlrun_distributions_contain_no_adapter`, which builds a distribution and
# looks inside it. So there is no configuration in which both go unchecked: in a checkout this
# module runs, and in an sdist the packaging test is what proves the directory should be
# missing. Same reasoning as T136's own two halves.
