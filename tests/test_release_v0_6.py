"""The v0.6 release pass, packaging half. Item 9; SPEC-v0.6 §8's T181.

**T181 — core still installs nothing new.** v0.6 adds `ctrlrun[postgres]`, and an extra is only
an extra while `pip install ctrlrun` does not pull it in. The wheel and the sdist carry no
adapter, no research tree and no sector pack.

T180 — that no release document blurs alteration with authorship — is **not** here, and its
absence is deliberate rather than a deletion. It scans five documents and three of them are
pages now, so it runs in `CTRLRun/ctrlrun-docs`, the one checkout that can read both trees, as
`tests/test_release_documents.py`. It still covers this repository's `README.md` and
`CHANGELOG.md`, and this repository's CI runs it from there against the commit being proposed:
the `docs` job. Splitting the scan in two would have been two implementations of one rule, and
two rules that eventually disagree.

    build had already accounted for them.

    `research/` is the new name here. `research/framework-probe/` and `research/soak/` are both

    T136 grew the `research/` and `packs/` check when item 8's `tests/test_soak.py` needed a
    guarantee behind its skip; §8 asks T181 for all three in one place as the release check, and
    the two are allowed to agree. What is not allowed is neither of them running, which is why
    the skip below is the whole repository being absent and nothing narrower.
