"""The ACS control hook. SPEC-v0.2 §9 (amended), acceptance tests T51-T55.

ACS is an *advisory* interface: a Guardian returns a decision and the platform executes. That
is the opposite way round from `@protect`, where ctrlrun runs the executor — so the adapter
splits one action across two hooks. `steps/toolCallRequest` decides and takes the
reservation; `steps/toolCallResult` closes it with what actually happened.

The two are joined by `Suspended`/`Control.resume` (§6.9), which already exists for exactly
this shape: a reservation held across a round trip the kernel does not control.

Read against the ACS v0.1.0 schemas, commit c7ad162 (2026-08-11):
