"""Concurrency and failure injection against a real Postgres. Item 4; SPEC-v0.6 §4.5, §8.

**What was run, stated first, because §4.5 requires the PR to say so.** These are separate OS
processes against one Postgres, with the connection broken by a proxy this test owns. They are
**not two hosts**. Separate processes give separate connections, no shared memory and no shared
file locks -- which is what `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` was silently relying on and what a second host
removes -- so the *reservation* guarantee is exercised. What is not exercised is a network
partition between two machines, and the PR says so rather than implying otherwise.

The failure injection is better than a container for what §4.5 calls its most important test.
Killing a container reproduces "the connection died during `COMMIT`" only when the timing happens
to land there; a proxy that forwards the `COMMIT` and *then* drops the client reproduces it every
time. A test which "usually" reproduces an interleaving proves nothing about the run where it
did not.

**What an independent review had to fix here, because the list is the useful part.** The first
version of this file passed while exercising almost none of what it named:

- The child processes imported `ctrlrun` from a **hardcoded absolute path**, so gutting the store
  under test left T157 and T158 green. They now import the tree this file lives in and *assert*
  that they did.
- T155b and T155 only ever reached Table A1 **row 1** and Table A2 **row 1** -- the proxy
  forwarded every `COMMIT`, so the write always landed and the "re-issue" and "retry the insert"
  rows the section exists for were unreachable. `drop_before_commit` reaches them, and driving
  A2 row 2 found an **unbounded recursion** in the store (fixed in this PR's `postgres.py`).
- T155 asserted an outcome that a store doing *nothing* also produces. It now asserts which
  branch of §4.3.2 ran, which is what §8 asked for and nothing implemented.
- `clients_killed` triggered on `b"COMMIT" in data`, which a Bind *parameter* satisfies. See
  `failure_injection._Frontend`.
- T158b's partition injected nothing observable and delivered a reset at a deadline the proxy
  owned; its restart half terminated zero backends.
