"""Atomic reservation across processes. Build-list item 6; SPEC-v0.1 §5.3; T3, T12.

The guarantee under test is E1: `reserve_effect` succeeds for at most one caller per effect
key, across threads *and processes*. Threads would pass with a `threading.Lock`; agents run
as separate workers, so T3 uses `multiprocessing` with the "spawn" start method — the same
start method on Linux and macOS — against one on-disk SQLite file.

Nothing here counts executions in a Python object: eight processes share no memory. The fake
remote appends one line to a file per call, and the count is the line count.
