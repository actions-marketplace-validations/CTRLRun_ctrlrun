"""The LangGraph reference adapter. SPEC-v0.5 §3.5, §6, §7; T135, T135b, T137.

Every test here drives a **real compiled graph with a real checkpointer**, and the round trip
goes out through `interrupt()` and back through `Command(resume=...)`. No model is involved:
the graph has one node that calls the protected tool, which is what a tool node does once the
model has chosen a call, and the question these tests ask is about the adapter rather than
about what a model would decide.

Skipped **by name** where `langgraph` is not installed, so a green run with the framework
missing cannot look like a pass (`v0.4 §7` T123's rule, applied here).
