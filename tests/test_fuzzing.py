"""The fuzz targets under `fuzz/`, and the invariants they assert.

`SPEC-v0.1.md` §2.3 calls canonicalization security-critical, and it is the one place where a
defect is silent: two distinct actions sharing a canonical form share an approval, and nothing in a
receipt would look wrong. `Policy.from_yaml`'s docstring makes the other promise -- "anything
malformed raises `PolicyError`" -- which is the fail-closed rule in a single sentence, and a
loader that raised `KeyError` instead would still deny, but through a crash nobody classified.

Both are properties rather than examples, so both are fuzzed. The invariants live in
`fuzz/properties.py` and **carry no dependency on Atheris**: the fuzzer is one driver for them
and this suite is another, so they are exercised on every commit whether or not anybody has a
fuzzing toolchain installed. `fuzz/fuzz_*.py` are the Atheris entry points.

A property that cannot fail proves nothing, so every invariant here has a positive control
that breaks it deliberately and requires the check to notice.
