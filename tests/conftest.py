"""Fixtures shared across the suite.

`state_store` is parametrized over both shipped implementations. A reservation test written
once therefore runs against `InMemoryStateStore` and `SQLiteStateStore`, which is how the
double is kept from drifting into refusing less than the real store (SPEC-v0.1 §5.3).

`no_network` is the other shared double, and it is here for the same reason. "Runs with no
network" is a claim until something takes the network away, and the guard that takes it away
was written twice -- once in `test_examples.py`, once in the documentation tools -- which is
two chances for one copy to refuse less than the other and make one suite's claim quietly
weaker. The documentation tools are a separate repository now; this is the library's one
definition, and both suites that need it take it from here.
