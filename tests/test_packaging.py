"""The dependency rule. Build-list item 6a; SPEC-v0.2 §1.1, and the first half of T30.

`pip install ctrlrun` must not grow. An extra's module imports lazily, and a missing extra
raises `MissingDependency` naming the install command — never `ImportError`, which reads to
an operator as a broken package rather than an unselected option.

T30's own assertion, that a **subprocess** running `import ctrlrun` pulls in no module from
an extra, lands with item 8 when there is a second extra to check. The subprocess matters:
in-process it would pass or fail on whatever pytest happened to import first.
