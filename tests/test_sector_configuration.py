"""The throwaway sector configuration. Item 7; SPEC-v0.6 §7.5, §8 T177b.

**The artefact is disposable; what it finds is the deliverable.** §7.5 asks item 7 to write one
sector's configuration as YAML against the primitives, assert it loads and drives a decision, and
**ship it nowhere** — it lives here, in no `packs/` directory, no `examples/`, and no
distribution. This is `v0.5 §8`'s device, the third adapter written against the contract alone,
and its output is the same shape: a list of what the primitives could not express.

The sector is a hospital's patient-record system, chosen because it exercises every primitive at
once — labels on arguments, a rule that has to see them, controls citing a clinical governance
document, and a threshold that decides who has to say yes.

## What it found

Recorded here rather than in a commit message, because §7.5 says the findings are the point.

1. **`redact:` was not needed, and this configuration is the reason it is being cut.** See
   `test_the_finding_that_redaction_was_not_needed` below, which is the argument in full.

2. **A control cannot be cited by a `decision:` shorthand entry and a rule at once**, because an
   entry has *either* `decision:` or `rules:`. That is not a defect: an action with one decision
   has one place to cite from. Written down because the first draft of this file tried it.

3. **`data:` labels an argument, not a return value.** A protected function that *returns* PHI
   declares nothing, and `data_scope` sees only what went in. That is the right scope for v0.6 —
   a decision is made before the call, so a label on the result could not inform it — but a pack
   author will expect otherwise and the section should say so. **This is an edit to §7.4.**

def test_the_finding_that_redaction_was_not_needed() -> None:
    """**§7.4 put `redact:` on probation and this configuration does not earn it. It is cut.**

    The reasoning, because §7.4 asks for the cut to be recorded rather than merely made:

    - The configuration needs a rule to *see* that an argument is PHI, which `data:` gives it.
      That is the primitive a pack cannot be written without, and it is not on probation.
    - It does **not** need the value hidden from the evidence. A trust that may not have a
      diagnosis in its receipt store may not have it in the record system either; redaction in
      ctrlrun's evidence would be a second, weaker copy of a control that has to live upstream,
      and shipping it invites an operator to believe the weaker one is the control.
    - The one place a value must be visible is the **approval payload**, which §7.4 already
      exempts -- and once a human has to see the real diagnosis to approve the change, redacting
      the same value in the receipt hides it from the auditor and not from anybody else.
    - `v0.6`'s scope rule is that a field added for a pack nobody is writing is a guess that gets
      frozen. `redact:` is exactly that, and this is the configuration that was supposed to earn
      it.

    So the primitive is not implemented, the `redact:` key is **refused at load** rather than
    silently ignored, and §7.4 and §12 record the cut. Refusing rather than ignoring is the
    important half: an operator who writes `redact: true` and gets no error would believe the
    value is hidden.
