"""The adapter surface. SPEC-v0.5 §2, §3, §4; T126-T129h.

Every test here that asserts a refusal counts the interrupt double's calls and asserts the
count, because a refusal is satisfied just as well by a run in which the adapter was never
reached at all -- and that run passes against a surface with the guard deleted (SPEC-v0.4 §1.3).
Where the count alone would not distinguish two guards, the test carries a **control**: the same
configuration with the guard's precondition removed, reaching the next refusal instead.

    """SPEC-v0.10 §9's `hop=`/`task=` row, and the defect it names.

    A framework asks this predicate **before** it invokes. Without `hop=` the predicate evaluated
    against the receiver's whole candidate set -- here a root grant covering `payment:*` -- while
    `execute` evaluates against the hop **alone** (§2.3, no fallback). So it answered "a human is
    needed" for a call `execute` then refuses outright: the framework surfaces an approval item, a
    human says yes, and the tool call fails anyway.

    **Not an authority hole, and the test says which it is.** `Control.execute` is the enforcement
    point and refuses either way, so nothing wider ever runs. What the gap cost was the framework's
    own approval item and a receipt nobody could explain.

    The `without` case is what makes this discriminating: it proves the hop is what changed the
    answer, rather than a fixture in which everything is denied anyway (mutation pattern 3).
