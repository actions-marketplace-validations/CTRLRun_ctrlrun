"""The attempt ceiling, `max_attempts`. Build-list item 4; SPEC-v0.7 §5, §8.4 (T240 to T252).

`v0.1 §5.4`'s `FAILED` row permits a renewal and bounds nothing. An executor that raises
`NotExecuted` on every call is therefore an unlimited number of provider dispatches, each one
individually correct and the sequence as a whole unbounded. §5's amendment bounds it where the
operator's policy entry says so, and leaves it exactly as it was where the entry says nothing.

**Two defences, two tests, because defence in depth hides mutations** (`CONTRIBUTING.md`). The
guarantee is the comparison against the attempt number **the store assigned**, taken after the
reservation and before the executor: two callers who both read `N-1` both pass a read taken
before reserving, and only the assigned number is atomic by construction. The read before the
approval gate is a fast path that saves a write, a spent approval and a human's attention, and
it is never the guarantee. T245 reaches the check with the fast path live, through the public
route §5.5 describes, and T245b reaches the fast path by the evidence only it leaves.

**Every refusal is asserted by its `reason`**, never by its type alone (mutation pattern 1): an
`ActionDenied` is also what a policy denial raises, and an `EFFECT_RESERVATION_REFUSED` is also
what a duplicate or an ambiguous record appends.

    G13/G15/G14 as easily as a conflict, and the table then simply prints out of order while
    every count still adds up and every id is still present.

    **This is a second guard, not the only one, and the difference matters.** An earlier
    docstring here claimed nothing else would have noticed the swap; a review checked and it is
    untrue. `tests/test_verify.py`'s catalogue test has asserted the same ordering since before
    this branch existed, and it fails on the same mutation. What this one adds is locality: the
    merge that could produce the swap is item 4's, and a reader of item 4's tests should find
    the assertion that governs it here rather than in another file. `BY_ID`'s own order is the
    part `test_verify.py` does not assert.
