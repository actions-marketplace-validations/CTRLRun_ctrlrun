"""Policy versioning and the control registry. Item 7; SPEC-v0.6 §7, §8 T171-T177d.

Two things in one item because both answer *"what decided this, and can I still tell?"* — the
policy hash on every receipt, and the registry that says which written expectation a rule serves.

The sharpest rule in this file is §7.3's second: **a control is attribution, not prevention.**
Citing `maker-checker-refunds` on a rule does not cause an approval; the rule's `decision:
approve` does. Any test whose name or docstring implies otherwise would be a false green in prose,
so the tests are written to say what a control *records* and never what it enforces.
