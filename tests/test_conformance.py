#: that refused `socket.socket` outright refused the event loop rather than the network. That is
#: why T133's requirement to run *each reference adapter's* kit under it (§3.7) went
#: unimplemented -- the `openai-agents` harness drives a real `Runner` through `asyncio.run`,
#: and the guard stopped it at loop construction with `AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM`, one frame inside
#: `asyncio/selector_events.py:_make_self_pipe`. A local IPC pipe is not reaching the network,
#: and a test that called it one would be `v0.4 §1.3`'s false positive rather than a finding.
#:
#: `AF_INET` and `AF_INET6` are refused, and so are `create_connection` and `getaddrinfo`, which
#: is the whole of what "an adapter opens no socket" means. The precondition test proves the
