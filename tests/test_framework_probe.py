"""The research harness. SPEC-v0.4 §7; T122-T124b.

`research/framework-probe/` is outside `src/` and is not on the import path, so these tests put
it there themselves. That is the same fact T124b asserts from the other side: after
`pip install .` neither `research` nor `framework_probe` is importable, because neither is
packaged.

T122 needs its **pair**. A stub that retries reporting `executed_twice` proves nothing on its
own: a harness hard-coded to say `executed_twice` would satisfy it, and would say the same
thing about every real framework it ever ran.
