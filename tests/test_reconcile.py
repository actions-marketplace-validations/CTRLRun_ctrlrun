"""The reconciliation hook. Build-list item 1; SPEC-v0.2 §2.

`AMBIGUOUS` is the state only a human could leave in v0.1. v0.2 admits one other authority: a
`reconcile` hook that asks the remote what happened, and moves the record only where its
answer points. Everything about it is arranged so that a hook which cannot answer changes
nothing — an exception, a nonsense return value and a hook that is never called all mean
`"unknown"`, and `"unknown"` is the value with no effect.
