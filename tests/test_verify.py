"""`ctrlrun verify` — the registry, the engine, G1-G6 and G10. SPEC-v0.4 §2, §3; T100-T107.

T125 and T125b live here too, despite sitting at the end of the number range: they are the two
guards on verify lying about itself (§8), and item 1 is where they belong.

Every test that asserts a guarantee **passes** also has to show it can fail — a verify whose
every guarantee is hard-coded to pass satisfies T100 perfectly — so T104 and T125 inject a
broken kernel and a broken control and require the report to go red.
