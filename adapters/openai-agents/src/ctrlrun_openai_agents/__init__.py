"""Route a ctrlrun `APPROVE` through the OpenAI Agents SDK's own tool-approval interruption.
SPEC-v0.5 §2, §3.5.

**An adapter exists for exactly one reason**, and this is the whole of it: when a policy says a
refund needs a human, the SDK stops the run with a `ToolApprovalItem` and the human answers
through `state.approve(...)` / `state.reject(...)` — where this SDK's users already answer —
instead of `ApprovalRequired` being raised past the runner.

This is the **decided-before-invocation** shape (§3.5), and it is the other of the two the
contract covers. The SDK asks whether a tool call needs approval *before* it invokes the tool,
so the adapter answers that question with `ctrlrun.adapter.needs_approval` — which resolves the
principal from the `Control`, builds the Action and evaluates, and **writes nothing**, so a
predicate the SDK may call more than once leaves no events behind.

**You probably do not need this.** `@protect` covers anything in this process with no adapter
and no framework support. This buys the interrupt and nothing else.

Supported kernel range: `ctrlrun>=0.5,<0.13`.
Supported framework range: `openai-agents>=0.20,<1.0`.
`README.md` states both, and states why this adapter's binding is **attribution** where
LangGraph's is prevention.

    request is left `pending` so `ctrlrun approve` can still answer it out of band.

    It is raised on the two paths where this adapter cannot see an answer:

    * The call reached `Control.execute` without going through `protected_tool`, so no SDK tool
      call is in scope at all -- a plain `function_tool`, a background job, or any other
      `@protect(wait=True)` on the same `Control`. The provider hangs off the `Control` and not
      off the tool, so nothing else links the two.
    * The SDK's own gate never asked about **this call**, which the per-call approval lookup
      reports as `None`. That happens whenever `needs_approval` and the kernel disagree -- the
      predicate sees the arguments the model sent, `Control.execute` sees the arguments the
      function was called with after Python applied its defaults (§3.5) -- and also when the
      human answered with `always_approve`, which records a decision about the *tool* and not
      about this call.
    * The approval belongs to a **different action**. One tool body may raise
      `ApprovalRequired` more than once; the SDK's record is keyed by the tool call, so without
      this a single yes authorized every action raised under it.
    * A **second** approval request arrives under one tool call. One human answer authorizes
      one request.

    `ToolApprovalItem`, somebody called `state.approve(item)`, and the SDK re-ran and invoked the
    tool. So this returns the grant the SDK already holds.

    **`carries_approved_arguments` is `False`, and it is not a setting.** It is a fact about this
    framework: the arguments a human answered against live on the `ToolApprovalItem`, which the
    *caller* holds in `RunResult.interruptions` and which is not reachable from a tool body — the

    its arguments were. An adapter that handed back the tool's own parameters would be handing
    back what it was given, which SPEC-v0.5 §3.4 names as manufacturing the check.

        There is no call out to the framework here, and that is this shape: the SDK asked before
        it invoked, so the answer already exists by the time a tool body reaches
        `Control.execute`. The adapter's job is to *read* it — asking again would be a second
        approval path.

        Reading it is the whole of the job, and this method used to skip it. It returned
        `granted=True` unconditionally, on the premise that *a tool body that runs is the
        approval*. That premise holds only when the SDK's gate actually asked and was told yes,
        and there are reachable paths where it did not:

        * A `@protect(wait=True)` call on the same `Control` that never went through
          `protected_tool`. The provider hangs off the `Control`, not off the tool.
        * A call the SDK's gate passed without asking, because `needs_approval` and the kernel
          saw different arguments — the predicate sees what the model sent, `Control.execute`
          sees what the function was called with after Python applied its defaults. §3.5 says
          that divergence is harmless *because the human is asked anyway*; a self-granting
          `interrupt()` is what made it unsafe, and the fix belongs here rather than in §3.5.

        On both, an `APPROVE` executed with no human and wrote a receipt naming an approver
        nobody was — a grant fabricated into the evidence log, which is what §2.3's ban on
        `StateStore.append_event` exists to prevent, reached through the sanctioned door.

        The SDK's record is read **per call** by `_answer_for_this_call`, which has the three
        states this needs: `True` (a human approved this call), `False` (a human refused it) and
        `None` (nobody was asked about it). Only the first two are answers, and the public
        `is_tool_approved` is not what is read -- see that helper for why.

        The record answers for a **tool call**, and a tool body may raise `ApprovalRequired`
        more than once. So the answer is bound to the action `protected_tool` gated and to one
        request: a refund's yes does not authorize a wire raised beside it.

        A **rejection** normally never reaches here: the SDK does not invoke a tool whose
        approval was refused, so the run ends with the rejection in its own output and no
        ctrlrun action is proposed. §7 of `README.md` records that, because it is the one place
        this adapter's evidence differs from `@protect`'s. `False` is still returned as a
        denial rather than assumed unreachable — a human's *no* is an answer, and §2.4 says it

    case §12.7 is about. It is deliberately **not** "the first `CTRLRunError` in the chain":
    see the walk below for why that reached past the outcome into a nested failure.

    This SDK wraps whatever a tool raises in `agents.exceptions.UserError` -- *"Error running
    tool run_it: ..."* -- and chains the original as `__cause__`. So an operator's
    `except DuplicateEffect` does not fire, and `except ActionDenied` does not fire, and the
    one interface this library has for saying *the tool did not run* is lost in transit.

    `v0.1 §8` prefers explicit exceptions over return codes for exactly this reason, and
    `v0.2 §6.10` argues the same point about the gateway: a refusal by ctrlrun is not an outcome
    of the tool, it is the statement that the tool did not run, and it must be distinguishable.
    So this walks the chain and gives it back.

    It changes no decision and grants nothing: it re-raises what already happened, in the type
    the kernel raised it as.

    **`__cause__` only, never `__context__`.** `__cause__` is explicit chaining -- `raise X from
    Y` -- and is the only link that asserts *this error is behind that one*. `__context__` is
    what the interpreter sets whenever any exception is raised while another is being handled,
    and it asserts nothing about causation.

    Following it here was a hole rather than a nicety. `@protect(wait=True)` runs its approved
    leg **inside** `except ApprovalRequired as pending:`, so every exception on that leg carries
    `__context__ = ApprovalRequired`. An executor that raised a `TimeoutError` after the request
    went out -- which the kernel records as AMBIGUOUS and re-raises unchanged, `v0.1 §5.5` --
    was walked back to that `ApprovalRequired` and handed to the caller as *"requires approval,
    then retry"*. An ambiguous outcome reported as a definite did-not-run, with instructions to
    do it again, on the one path this adapter exists for.
    """
    # Bounded by the exceptions already visited, because an exception chain is not guaranteed
    # to be a chain. `raise X from Y` sets `X.__cause__ = Y`, and doing that where `Y.__cause__`

    # output looped forever on exactly the AMBIGUOUS outcome it exists to preserve. That is

    # from Y` where `Y.__cause__` is already `X` closes a loop, and an unbounded walk never
    # leaves it. `_reraise` keeps this module from building one; this holds for a chain built
    # anywhere else, and the two are tested separately because either alone would hide the other.

    """Re-raise the kernel's exception, without closing a cycle in the `__cause__` chain.

    `raise recovered from raised` reads naturally and was wrong: `recovered` was found *by
    walking* `raised.__cause__`, so setting `recovered.__cause__ = raised` points the chain back
    at something that already points here. `unwrap` then walked it forever, and it did so on the
    two paths that most need an answer -- an executor whose `TimeoutError` the kernel recorded
    as AMBIGUOUS and re-raised (`v0.1 §5.5`), and this adapter's own `ApprovalNotAsked`.

    There is no `from` clause at all, and no condition under which one would be right: `recovered`
    is reachable from `raised` **by construction**, because walking `raised.__cause__` is how it
    was found. So `raise recovered from raised` closes a cycle every time, not just sometimes --
    a first attempt at this guarded on `recovered.__cause__ is None` and still built one, because
    the kernel's exception legitimately has no cause of its own while the SDK's wrapper points
    at it.

    Nothing is lost. `recovered.__cause__` stays `None`, which is true -- an `ActionDenied` was
    not *caused by* the `UserError` that wrapped it -- and raising inside an `except` block sets
    `__context__` to the wrapper, which is what a traceback prints and how the SDK's frames stay
    visible.
