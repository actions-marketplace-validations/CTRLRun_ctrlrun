"""Route a ctrlrun `APPROVE` through LangGraph's own `interrupt()`. SPEC-v0.5 §2, §3.

**An adapter exists for exactly one reason**, and this is the whole of it: when a policy says a
refund needs a human, the human answers *where LangGraph users already answer* — through
`interrupt()` and `Command(resume=...)`, in whatever queue or console the deployment already
routes those to — instead of `ApprovalRequired` being raised past the graph.

Everything else is the kernel's, unchanged. The policy, the authority evaluation, the exact
binding, the reservation, the receipt: all of it is `Control` doing what it does under
`@protect`, because this module reserves nothing, commits nothing, grants nothing and
constructs no `Control`. What it contributes is the two lines in `interrupt()` below.

**You probably do not need this.** `@protect` already covers anything running in this process,
including a LangChain tool and a raw model call, with no adapter and no framework support. This
buys one thing over it: the interrupt. If your graph has nowhere for a human to answer, or you
are happy for `ApprovalRequired` to reach your own code, use `@protect` and stop here.

Supported kernel range: `ctrlrun>=0.5,<0.13`. Supported framework range: `langgraph>=1.0,<2.0`.
`README.md` states both, and what this adapter's binding check is and is not.

    The operator wires it, on the line where they choose the policy and the store::

            policy, store,
            approvals=InterruptApprovalProvider(
                store, LangGraphInterrupt(carries_approved_arguments=True)

    and then calls `issue_refund` from a graph node, on a graph compiled with a checkpointer.
    `wait=True` is what routes the `APPROVE` here instead of raising past the graph.

    **This adapter never constructs the `Control`** (SPEC-v0.5 §2.3). Everything an adapter must
    not choose -- the identity provider, the authority document, the environment, the mode -- is
    chosen on the line above, by the person who deployed it.

    ``carries_approved_arguments`` has **no default**, and that is deliberate. It says whether
    your resume value carries back the arguments the human answered against, and therefore
    whether the binding across the interrupt is prevention or attribution (SPEC-v0.5 §3.4). The
    default somebody assumes is the one that does not check, so there isn't one. `README.md`
    argues both settings; `True` is right for almost every deployment, and it is what the
    conformance results in that file were produced with.
