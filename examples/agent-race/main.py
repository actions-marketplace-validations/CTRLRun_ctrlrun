"""Two agents, one effect: the second one loses, and loses before the remote is touched.

Both agents are doing the right thing. They resolve the same effect key, `refund:txn_123`,
because it is the same real-world effect — and a reservation is the right to execute it
once. Agent B arrives while A holds the key and is refused with `DuplicateEffect`.

The race is made deterministic rather than raced for: agent B runs from inside A's remote
call, which is exactly the window that matters and needs no sleeping to hit. Across
processes the guarantee is the same one, enforced by `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and a unique
constraint on the effect key rather than by a lock in this interpreter.

    python examples/agent-race/main.py

No network, and a state directory of its own under `.ctrlrun/examples/`.
