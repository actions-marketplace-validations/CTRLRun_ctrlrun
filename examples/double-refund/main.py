"""A lost response is not a failure, and a blind retry is a second refund.

The remote commits the refund and *then* the reply goes missing. That order is the whole
point: a remote that fails before doing anything is easy, and an executor can say so by
raising `NotExecuted`. This one is the dangerous kind, so ctrlrun records the outcome as
AMBIGUOUS rather than failed and refuses the retry. Nothing in this process knows whether
the money moved, and the one thing worse than not knowing is guessing.

    python examples/double-refund/main.py

No network, and a state directory of its own under `.ctrlrun/examples/`.
