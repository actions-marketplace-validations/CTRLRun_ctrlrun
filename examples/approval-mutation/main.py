"""An approval authorizes one exact action, not a category of action.

A human sees "refund €2,000 on txn_2" and says yes. The agent then executes €5,000 with
that same approval — the sort of thing a prompt injection asks for, and the sort of thing a
loop does by accident after re-planning. The approval is bound to the action's hash, which
covers the principal, the arguments, the resource and the environment, so the mutated call
matches nothing and is refused before the remote is touched.

    python examples/approval-mutation/main.py

No network, and a state directory of its own under `.ctrlrun/examples/`.
