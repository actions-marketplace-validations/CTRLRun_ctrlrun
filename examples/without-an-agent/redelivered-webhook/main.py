"""No model, no agent: a webhook delivered twice, and a payout sent twice.

Every webhook worth receiving is delivered at least once, which is a promise about the
minimum. Stripe, GitHub, Shopify, Slack, SNS and every queue behind them will re-deliver an
event whose acknowledgement they did not see — after a deploy, after a 502, after a handler
that took too long. The handler is called a second time with the same payload, and unless
something outside the handler remembers what the *first* call did, the payout goes twice.

An `Idempotency-Key` header does not help here: the second delivery is a second HTTP request
from a different process, and whatever key the handler generates it generates twice. What is
needed is a name for the consequence that both deliveries compute identically — the effect key
`payout:{payout_id}` — and one atomic reservation of it.

    python examples/without-an-agent/redelivered-webhook/main.py

No network, and a state directory of its own under `.ctrlrun/examples/`.
