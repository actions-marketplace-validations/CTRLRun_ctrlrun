"""A merge that landed, a reply that did not, and a job that goes looking for another way.

The merge queue merges pull request #4471. GitHub merges it, and the connection drops before
the response comes back. The job sees an exception, concludes the merge failed, and does the
two things any determined piece of automation does: it tries again, and when that does not
work it reaches for a different way to get the same result.

Both are refused, for two different reasons, and the second one is the interesting one. The
retry is refused because the effect may already have committed. The alternate route — force
pushing the branch to make the target look merged — is refused because the policy does not
list it, and an action the policy does not list is denied rather than allowed. Determination
is the property that makes automation useful and the property that makes it dangerous.

No network, and a state directory of its own under `.ctrlrun/examples/`.
