"""No model, no agent, no prompt: a task queue with automatic retry, charging twice.

This is the same failure as `examples/double-refund/`, written the way it actually reaches
production — the retry is not a line somebody wrote, it is the queue's `max_retries`. Celery,
RQ, Sidekiq, Temporal's activity retries, `tenacity`, a Lambda that a failed invocation
re-delivers: each of them re-runs the task when it raises, and each of them re-runs it just as
willingly when the exception means *I do not know what happened* as when it means *nothing
happened*.

The provider commits the charge and then the reply is lost. The queue does what it is
configured to do. ctrlrun records the outcome as AMBIGUOUS rather than failed, and the second
attempt is refused before it reaches the provider.

    python examples/without-an-agent/retried-task/main.py

No network, and a state directory of its own under `.ctrlrun/examples/`.
