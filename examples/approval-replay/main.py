"""An approval is worth exactly one execution.

The human's yes is spent the moment it authorizes a run. An agent that keeps the request id
around — in a scratchpad, in a retry loop, in a replayed transcript — and presents it again
is presenting something that no longer exists. The record says `consumed`, and consumption
happens in the same store transaction as the reservation, so two processes racing on one
approval cannot both win it.

    python examples/approval-replay/main.py

No network, and a state directory of its own under `.ctrlrun/examples/`.
