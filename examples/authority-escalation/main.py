"""A delegated grant cannot be wider than the one it came from, and it is re-checked.

Three links: a human who holds €100,000 and may delegate, a finance agent given €25,000, a
support agent given €2,000. Then the two ways of stepping outside the chain, which fail at
two different moments and for two different reasons:

- the support agent **asks for €50,000** — refused at evaluation, `authority_constraint`;
- the finance agent **tries to mint €50,000** under its own €25,000 — refused at creation,
  `containment`, naming the dimension it widened.

Asserting only one would hide the other. The second is the one worth sitting with: an agent
that could delegate more authority than it holds could reach the first amount by minting its
own permission, and every check at evaluation would still pass.

The last part is not an escalation at all. The support agent asks for €1,500, which its grant
permits — and the policy still stops to ask a human, because authority and policy are separate
axes and an action needs both.

No network, and a state directory of its own under `.ctrlrun/examples/`.
