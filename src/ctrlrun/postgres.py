"""`PostgresStateStore`. Build-list item 3; SPEC-v0.6 §4.

The same frozen protocol of `v0.1 §5.3`, extended by nothing, with a different mechanism
underneath. `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` is a whole-database write lock on a local file; take the file away
and put the store on another host and E1 -- *at most one caller per effect key, across threads and
processes* -- has to be re-earned.

**The mechanism.** `UNIQUE(effect_key)` plus `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, under `READ
COMMITTED`, which is Postgres's default and which this store does **not** set. The guarantee is
the unique index, not the isolation level. Every later transition is a compare-and-set --
`UPDATE … WHERE effect_key = %s AND state = %s AND action_id = %s AND attempt = %s` -- with **the
row count checked**. The attempt is SPEC-v0.7 §5.6's: every write is conditioned on the attempt
number it read, so none can put an older one back.

**The decisions stay where they are.** `plan_reservation`, `plan_lease_extension`,
`check_consumable` and `check_answerable` are pure functions in `effect.py` and `approval.py`, and
both existing backends decide with them and then only write. This one does the same, so
`v0.1 §5.4`'s retry table has one implementation rather than three and a backend cannot drift into
permitting something SQLite refuses. That is the property `ctrlrun.conformance.store` exists to
check and this structure exists to make true.

**Two ambiguities, one word.** An exception raised *before* `COMMIT` is issued means nothing
committed: the store write is `FAILED` and may be retried. An exception *during or after* `COMMIT`
means nobody knows, and the answer is to **re-read the record** -- §4.3.2. Only if the re-read
itself fails does the store refuse to let execution proceed, writing no effect state. An ambiguous
*remote effect* has no such move, which is why `AMBIGUOUS` is terminal there; collapsing the two
would either refuse work a single query could have recovered or retry work nothing can.

`ctrlrun[postgres]`. `import ctrlrun` imports no `psycopg` module (T153).

    §5.1 contemplates two attempts sharing one, so *"a record carrying our `action_id`"* is
    satisfied by another process's live reservation -- one logical effect executed twice, through
    the storage layer.

    `created_at` and `updated_at` are here and were missing. §4.3.3 lists them, and without them a
    **frozen injected clock** -- which `verify` and the conformance backend both use -- made two
    attempts indistinguishable, and the store concluded it held a key another attempt held. A
    review reproduced exactly that, and the test meant to catch it passed only because the wall
    clock happened to move between the two.

    **And a residual §4.3.3 could not close, stated rather than implied.** Where two attempts are
    identical in *every* column -- same `action_id`, same `attempt`, and a clock that gave them
    the same `created_at`, `updated_at` and `lease_expires_at` -- no comparison can separate
    "our commit landed" from "somebody else's identical commit landed", because the record is the
    same record. §4.3.3 asked the store to fail closed there, and that is not implementable: the
    identical case *is* the indistinguishable case, so failing closed on it would refuse every
    ambiguous commit that actually landed and make the re-read pointless.

    What closes it is upstream: **`action_id` identifies one attempt**, `Action` generates a fresh
    one per attempt, and two concurrent attempts sharing one is a caller-side violation no store
    can defend against -- `action_id` is the store's whole notion of who holds a key. The columns
    here are what make the *realistic* collision detectable: a second attempt under the same id
    at any other instant, with any other lease, or at a different `attempt` number, differs in a
    column and is refused. SPEC-v0.6 §4.3.3 carries the argument.

    **On the renewal path `created_at` separates nothing**, and the paragraph above should not be
    read as if it did there. A renewal keeps the record's `created_at` (`_reserved` takes it from
    the record it renews), so the expected row takes it from the record the re-read found and it

    **A connection outlives the thread that opened it, and that is a real limit worth stating.**
    A host running agents on a *bounded, recycled* thread pool is fine -- the same threads keep

    for real -- ninety-six connections across twelve rounds of eight threads -- and the failure
    surfaced in a case that had nothing to do with it.

        `holds` does not contend with `SELECT seq FROM receipt_chain ... FOR UPDATE`, and the
        prune's snapshot is READ COMMITTED. A review ran it multi-process and the prune deleted
        three receipts a hold had been placed over mid-flight::

            prune: holds consulted, []; now pausing where the operator's hold lands

            holds in the store now: [('litigation', 1, 3, True)]   <- live, over nothing

        Taking the same row lock here is what makes the prune's single consult authoritative: a
        hold cannot land while a prune holds it, and a prune cannot start while a hold is landing.
