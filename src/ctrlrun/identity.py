"""Where a `Principal` comes from. Build-list item 1; SPEC-v0.3 §3.

ctrlrun **consumes** identities. It verifies what it is handed and maps the result onto a
`Principal`; it issues nothing, mints nothing, and defines no identity format. That is the whole
of this module's remit, and it is why the two providers here are so small: one asserts a fixed
identity for development, the other reads a header a proxy was supposed to have set.

The rule that makes them matter is in `control.py`: once an `authority:` section exists, the
principal is an authorization input, so a provider's answer wins over anything the calling code
says, and a provider that *raises* is never backfilled from a `context()` (§3.2). A declining
provider is a different thing from a refusing one, and the distinction is the point.

`JWTIdentityProvider` — the one that actually verifies a credential — lands with build-list item
5 in `ctrlrun[identity]`, because it needs a third-party library and this module must not.
