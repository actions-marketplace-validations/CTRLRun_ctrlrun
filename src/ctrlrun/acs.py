"""An ACS control hook backed by ctrlrun. Ships in `ctrlrun[gateway]`.

Read against the Agent Control Standard v0.1.0 schemas in
`GenAI-Security-Project/agent-control-standard` at commit `c7ad162` (2026-08-11):
`specification/v0.1.0/request-envelope.json`, `response-envelope.json`,
`hooks/tool-call-request.json`, `hooks/tool-call-result.json` and `ask-details.json`.
`https://ctrlrun.dev/docs/ACS` records what was read and where the two models disagree.

**ACS is advisory; ctrlrun is executing.** A Guardian returns a decision and the *platform*
runs the tool, which is the opposite way round from `@protect`. So one action is split across
two hooks:

- `steps/toolCallRequest` builds the Action, decides it, takes the reservation, and suspends
  holding it — no outcome, no receipt;
- `steps/toolCallResult` closes that reservation with what actually happened.

The two are joined by `Suspended` and `Control.resume` (SPEC-v0.2 §6.9), which exist for
exactly this shape: a reservation held across a round trip the kernel does not control. The
adapter adds no second implementation of v0.1 §5.5's asymmetry; it translates ACS's
`exit_status` vocabulary into the kernel's and lets `Control` decide.

        — and a value that is only sometimes authoritative is one nobody can reason about.
        `params.metadata.environment` is ignored for the same reason, in `_action`.

        Where none is configured the envelope's own `agent_id` is read, exactly as v0.2 did.
        That is survivable only because a `Control` holding an `Authority` cannot be given to
        this hook without a provider (checked at construction): a self-reported name still
        misattributes a receipt, and still cannot widen an outcome.

        A declining provider is refused rather than backfilled from the envelope. Falling back
        there would reach `agent_id` by an easier route than forging a credential, which is
        the hole §3.2 closes for `context()` and the same hole in a different module.
