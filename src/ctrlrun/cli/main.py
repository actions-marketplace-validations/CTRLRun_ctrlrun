"""click command group for the ctrlrun CLI. Build-list item 8; SPEC-v0.1 §8.

The CLI is the human end of the kernel: it answers approval requests, shows the evidence,
and resolves the one state no machine may resolve for itself (§5.2). It is also the only
place in ctrlrun that prints.

Every command works on the store an agent is already using — `.ctrlrun/state.db` beside the
policy, or wherever `$CTRLRUN_STATE` says (§8) — so approving here answers the request an
agent is waiting on in another shell.

    §5.3's human authority had no route -- `ctrlrun effects` could not show a lapsed lease, and

    **It creates nothing, and it migrates nothing** -- a command an operator runs to *read*
    evidence must not have a side effect on the database it reads, which is `v0.4 §3.5`'s
    argument for verify's scratch store pointed the other way.

    Saying so was not enough. A review found this doing both: `PostgresStateStore.__init__`
    migrates, so `ctrlrun effects` against an empty schema printed "no effects yet", exited 0,
    and left eight tables behind -- and against a database stopped one migration short, a
    `ctrlrun receipts` applied it. On the milestone that introduces Postgres, which is the first
    one where a store is shared across hosts, that is a single reader altering a table every
    other process is still running against.

    §3.6 forbids a store that can open without migrating -- *"a second configuration nobody
