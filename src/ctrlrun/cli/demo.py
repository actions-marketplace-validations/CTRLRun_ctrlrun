"""The five-scenario demo with an in-process fake Stripe. SPEC-v0.1 §7 T11, SPEC-v0.3 §1.2.

Five ways an agent action goes wrong at the boundary between intention and effect, and what
ctrlrun does about each. Everything runs in this process: no network, no clock skew, no
sleeping. The fake remote is the only thing pretending — and it pretends in the one way that
matters, by committing before its response goes missing.

The demo keeps its evidence in `.ctrlrun/demo/`, never in the store a real agent is using:
it reserves effect keys and would otherwise collide with — or block — live work.
