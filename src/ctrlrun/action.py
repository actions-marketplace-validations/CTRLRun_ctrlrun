#: array at every issuer anybody deploys, and the rule this replaced -- that a provider flattens

#: unentitled. Flattening into a delimited string was rejected: that is structure encoded in a
#: string, and one role named `a,b` away from a defect.
#:
#: Safe where a hash is concerned: `v0.3 §2.2` keeps `claims` out of an action's canonical form,
#: so no action hash and no approval binding moves.

#: dataclass default, `mappingproxy` included, and 3.11 is the floor this package supports.
#: 3.12 relaxed that check to `list`/`dict`/`set` only, so the bare form passes there and fails
