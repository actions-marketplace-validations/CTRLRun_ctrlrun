"""Grants, patterns, containment and evaluation. Build-list item 2; SPEC-v0.3 §4.

Authority is the second axis. Policy answers *how much autonomy does this action have*, and
has never been able to see who is asking (`v0.1 §3.2` refuses `agent_eq` at load, and still
does). Authority answers *may this principal propose it at all*, and sees nothing else: a
grant carries no `decision:`, so how much autonomy an action has is the same for every
principal (§4.2, §4.7).

Three rules shape every function below.

**Opt-in, then fail-closed** (§4.1). A document with no `authority:` key produces no
`Authority` at all — `_optional_from_yaml` returns `None` and `Control` behaves exactly as
v0.2. A document with one governs every action, and no matching grant is `DENY`.

**The grammar is small on purpose** (§4.4). `fnmatch` would make `contains` — the relation
build-list item 3's attenuation rests on — an approximation rather than a decision. So: a
literal, a `prefix*` that cannot cross a separator, and a final `**` whose preceding segments
are all literals. Nothing else parses.

**This module is pure.** It reads a `StateStore` and never writes to one, and it appends no
event. `Control` does both (§4.8), which is what keeps `ARCHITECTURE.md` §6's single composer
single.
