"""Credential revocation, consumed (SPEC-v0.8 §6).

A verified token used to be valid until its `exp`, and this module ends that. It consumes
Security Event Tokens -- OpenID Shared Signals, the CAEP event types -- and answers one
question for `JWTIdentityProvider`: has this credential been revoked?

**Consuming only** (`v0.3 §1.1`). Nothing here issues a token, mints a key, serves an endpoint,
publishes a list or asks an introspection question. A feed reads what somebody else wrote.

**The feed can only ever refuse.** There is no path on which a feed's answer makes an
otherwise-invalid credential valid, which is the security property (§6.6): somebody who can
write the file can deny the operator's own agents, which is fail-closed and in the threat model,
and cannot admit a principal the issuer revoked.

Behind `ctrlrun[identity]`, beside the provider it serves, and never imported by
`import ctrlrun`: a feed that reached core would put a network client in the wheel every user
installs.

    a 302, and `HTTPRedirectHandler` permits `http`, `https` and `ftp` targets: an open
    redirect on the issuer's domain would make this process fetch its signing keys, in
    cleartext, from wherever the redirect pointed. Those keys are cached for the life of the
    process, so every token the attacker then signs verifies, with an arbitrary `agent` and
    `user`. That is the whole authority model, bypassed at the one input that decides who
    everybody is. The revocation feed is the same argument one step along: a redirect there
    decides which revocations this process never hears about.

    Subclassing and refusing is the reliable way to say "no redirects": passing an instance of
    a subclass *does* displace the default, which passing an unrelated handler does not.
