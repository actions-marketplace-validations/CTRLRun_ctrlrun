"""The OpenTelemetry sink. Build-list item 8; SPEC-v0.2 §8. Ships in `ctrlrun[otel]`.

An `EventSink` (§4) and nothing more: it never decides, never blocks, and never raises. What
it exports is a copy of what the store already holds, so a failing exporter is a lost export
and never a failed action — §4.2's rule, and the reason this is a sink rather than a hook.

**One span per action**, opened on `ACTION_PROPOSED` and carrying one span event per `Event`.
A retry is a new action and therefore a new span; the two are correlated by
`ctrlrun.effect_key`, which is the identity that actually spans attempts (v0.1 §5).
