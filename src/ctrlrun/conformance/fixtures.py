"""Adapters broken in one named way each, and one that is not. SPEC-v0.5 §5.4.

**A kit that only ever passes is a kit nothing exercises.** These exist so the kit's own tests
can require each fixture to fail the suite named for it -- which is `v0.4 §1.3`'s
positive-control rule one level up, and the reason item 3 comes before the reference adapters.
"Two adapters pass the suites" means nothing until the suite can fail.

`Reference` is the pair to all of them: no framework at all, just the surface, correct. Without
it, "the kit fails a broken adapter" is satisfied by a kit that fails everything.

None of these is a framework adapter. They implement `ConformanceAdapter` directly, in process,
so that what they break is the *contract* and never a framework's behaviour -- which is
`v0.4 §7.3` rule 6's line, held from the other side: the kit reports on adapters and the probe
reports on frameworks, and neither is allowed to editorialize about the other's subject.

    is aimed at `kernel`, where it swallows T6's denial of an unknown action, and §5.4's rule
    is that a suite whose only fixture fails it by accident is a suite nothing is aimed at.
    That is why `IgnoresAuthority` exists beside it, and this is the same argument one suite
    further along.

    The mistake is an authentic one, and it is the opposite of `SwallowsDenial`'s: not a no
    reported as a yes, but a no reported as a *fault*. An author whose framework raises when a
    human declines -- most do -- lets that exception stand as the outcome, reasoning that the
    call did not happen and the framework already said why. It did not happen, and ctrlrun's

    from the primitive having crashed -- §10's row for that says the request stays `pending`
    with no grant, no denial and no receipt, which is right for a crash and a silent loss of
    the record for an answer.

    It fails B3 on the **first** of that case's two checks -- what propagates is not
    `ActionDenied` -- and `DeniesForItself` is the pair that fails it on the second, because
    `expect` returns as soon as one is unmet and a single fixture therefore exercises exactly
    one. Two checks with one fixture between them is a subsumed guard: remove either and the
    other still fails the suite, and a test asserting only that the suite failed cannot tell
    which ran.

    It reaches the primitive, which is the point. The count cannot tell this from a correct
