"""What a backend hands the suite, and the two that already exist. SPEC-v0.6 §2.2.

`StoreBackend` is the whole of what a backend author implements to be graded. It is deliberately
four methods and no hook: the suite has no fault injection and no way to reach inside a store,
because a seam in shipping code that exists only for a test is what §1.1's last bullet forbids.
