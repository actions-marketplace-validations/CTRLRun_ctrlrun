"""The store conformance suite. Build-list item 1; SPEC-v0.6 §2.

It runs **this repository's own acceptance tests** -- the cases of `v0.1 §7`, `v0.2 §10` and
`v0.3 §10` that are statements about `StateStore` rather than about `Control` -- against any
backend. It is not a conformance programme, it certifies nothing, and passing it is not a claim
about a backend's quality. It answers one question: *does this backend refuse what SQLite
refuses, in the same way, for the same reason?*

**The suite predates the backend it grades**, and that ordering is the argument. A Postgres store
measured against a suite written for Postgres has marked its own homework, so item 1 comes before
item 3 and this package is written against the two backends that already exist.

**A kit that only ever passes is a kit nothing exercises.** `fixtures.py` ships thirteen stores
broken in one named way each, and T140 requires each to fail the suite named for it, by case and
by reason -- in both directions, so a suite no fixture fails and a fixture naming no real suite
are each a failure.

**Not applicable is not a pass.** §2.4 allows exactly two N/As, each a property of the backend
rather than of the harness: storage that cannot be opened from another process, and storage that
does not outlive the object holding it. Both describe `InMemoryStateStore`, which says so in its
own docstring, and `falsely-declares-no-url` is what keeps the declaration honest. SPEC-v0.7
§8 T214 adds exactly one more, also a property of the backend: a store that exposes no clock
measurement, because it reads only the application's clock. Any other N/A is a failure,
`report.ok` is `False` for a zero denominator, and there is no flag that folds one into the count.

Nothing in the kernel imports this package, and `import ctrlrun` does not reach it (T140f).

    `only` selects case ids; an unknown name **raises** rather than silently running everything
    or nothing. It is a keyword and not a CLI flag -- §9.4 adds no command, so there is nothing
    for an unknown name to exit from.

    `processes` is how many contenders the two E1 cases run, in threads and in OS processes
    respectively. It is `v0.1 §7` T3's eight by default. A review found it named in §2.4, §9.1
    and T143 while the code used a module constant, so the parameter that the specification
    freezes did not exist.

    Every case gets a freshly `reset()` backend, so no case can see another's rows. A case that
    raises out of its own body is reported as a failed case naming the exception, never as a
    crashed run: one broken case must not hide the twenty that worked.
