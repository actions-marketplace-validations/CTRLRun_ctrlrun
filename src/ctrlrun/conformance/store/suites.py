"""The store suites. SPEC-v0.6 §2.3, §2.4, §2.5.

Every case is a statement about a `StateStore` method rather than about `Control`'s composition
of them. The suite predates the backend it grades: a Postgres store measured against a suite
written for Postgres has marked its own homework, which is why item 1 comes before item 3.

Two rules every case obeys, both `v0.4 §1.3`'s positive-control rule one layer down:

- **It names the exception and, where the kernel defines one, its `state` or `reason`.** A guard
  distinguishable from a later guard only by reading the source is documentation.
- **It reads the record back.** "The attempt was refused" is satisfied just as well by a store
  that refuses everything; what a case asserts is the refusal *and* what the record then says.
