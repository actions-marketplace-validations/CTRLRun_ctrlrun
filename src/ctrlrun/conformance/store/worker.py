"""One contender in `reservation/e1-cross-process`. SPEC-v0.6 §2.4.

Reached as `python -m ctrlrun.conformance.store.worker` with its payload on stdin -- a
subprocess rather than `multiprocessing`, for `v0.4 §12.5`'s reason: `spawn` re-imports the
caller's `__main__`, and requiring an `if __name__ == "__main__"` guard in a backend author's
test file is not a trade a conformance suite gets to make.

The fake remote is an `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` file, so "called exactly once" survives the process
boundary -- a counter in memory would not, which is the whole reason this case is not the
in-process one.

    started "at once" still arrive one at a time. An independent review measured the first
