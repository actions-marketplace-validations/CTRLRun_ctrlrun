"""The broken-store fixtures. SPEC-v0.6 §2.6.

**A suite that only ever passes is a suite nothing exercises.** Each store here is broken in one
named way, and T140 requires each to fail the suite named for it -- by **case** and by **reason**,
because a test asserting only that `reservation` failed cannot tell you which check ran. That is
`v0.5 §5.4`'s finding one layer down.

Every fixture wraps a real backend and subverts one method, so what is being tested is the
suite's ability to notice, not a hand-built store's ability to be wrong in many ways at once.

Two of them exist because of the review of `SPEC-v0.6.md` rather than by foresight:
`falsely-declares-no-url`, because §2.4's two N/As are the only declarations on this surface and
a declaration that turns a suite off is a setting that relaxes a check; and the pairing of
`guesses-failed` with `raises-not-executed`, because `outcome` has two checks and one fixture
would have left the other subsumed.
