"""The suites, and what an adapter hands the kit. SPEC-v0.5 §5.2, §5.3.

Every case drives **one** protected call through the adapter's own framework and asserts what
the kernel would have done. The kit supplies the policy, the store, the `Control` and the
executor; the adapter supplies the framework and the courier that carries a human's answer
back. That division is the whole test: an adapter's only contribution to an action's fate
should be *where the human answers*, and a case that came out differently through an adapter
than through `@protect` is the finding.

Two things every case does, and both are `v0.4 §1.3`'s positive-control rule one level up:

- **It counts executor calls.** "The second attempt was refused" is satisfied just as well by
  an adapter that never reached the executor at all, and that adapter passes every refusal.
- **It names the exception and its reason**, not merely that something was raised. A guard
  that can only be distinguished from a later guard by reading the source is documentation.

    -- because `@protect(wait=True)` raises `ApprovalRequired` again on that pass and creates
    its own request (SPEC-v0.5 §3.2.1). The LangGraph reference adapter is what showed it: the
    kit asserted `== 1` and a correct adapter scored 4/5. Demanding an exact count would be
    asserting a *framework's* shape rather than an adapter's behaviour, which is the line
    `v0.4 §7.3` rule 6 draws in the other direction. What the count is for is distinguishing
    "the framework was asked" from "it was not", and `>= 1` does that exactly. A1 keeps `== 0`,
    because there the claim is that nobody was asked at all.

    It exists because of a fixture. `GrantsForItself` wrote the grant before `@protect` ever
    reached `wait()`, so the provider found the record already `granted`, returned it, and the
    framework's primitive was never called -- and every suite passed. The provider is right to
    return an already-granted record (`ctrlrun approve` grants out of band, and so does a
    webhook, and `v0.1 §4.3` says a provider never invents an answer), so the hole is not
    there: it is that a suite asserting a *refusal* cannot tell "the human said no through the
    framework" from "the framework was never asked".

    So the kit counts. A case that expects a human asserts the count is **at least 1** -- per
    the first paragraph, which is the rule -- and one that expects none asserts it is exactly 0.

    An unchecked `not_applicable` is a pass an adapter awards itself. The first version of this

    which a framework that refuses *inside* ctrlrun satisfies just as well. A second independent

    `fixtures.DenialIsAnError`, the fixture §5.4 requires to **fail** this suite — and got

    The discriminator is not what the adapter did with the answer; it is **whether ctrlrun was

    `ACTION_PROPOSED`, no `APPROVAL_REQUESTED`, and the framework's own primitive is never
    reached, because `@protect` never got far enough to raise `ApprovalRequired`. An adapter that
    produced any of those was asked, and the suite applies to it.
