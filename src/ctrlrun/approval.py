An approval authorizes one exact action: it carries the `action_hash` of what a human saw,
it can be used once, and it expires. Everything here exists to make those three properties
hard to lose. The store performs the state transitions (they must be atomic); this module
owns the models, the reason vocabulary, and the two providers that ask a human.
