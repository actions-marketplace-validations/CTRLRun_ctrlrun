"""The webhook approval provider. Build-list item 7; SPEC-v0.2 §7.

Core, not an extra, because the outbound half needs neither an HTTP server nor a third-party
SDK: it is one signed POST over stdlib `urllib.request`. Only the inbound endpoint needs a
server, and that is the gateway's (§7.2).

The signature is over the **exact bytes sent**. Two encoders that agree on meaning and differ
on whitespace would produce a MAC the receiver cannot verify, and a receiver that
re-serialized the payload to check would be verifying its own guess rather than what arrived.
