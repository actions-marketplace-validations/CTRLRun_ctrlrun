"""The MCP gateway. Build-list item 6; SPEC-v0.2 §6. Ships in `ctrlrun[gateway]`.

Nothing here is imported by `import ctrlrun` (SPEC-v0.2 §1.1): the package is reachable only
by naming it, and the HTTP client it needs is resolved at call time, so a core install that
never runs a gateway never pays for one — and never fails at import to say so.

The listening side is stdlib `http.server` (§6.11). The extra's only dependency is an HTTP
client with a connect/write/read exception taxonomy precise enough to feed §6.8's first row:
"the connection was never established" is the one claim in that table that asserts
non-execution, and it is only provable if no request byte can have been written.
