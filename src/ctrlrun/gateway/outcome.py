"""SPEC-v0.2 §6.8, and nothing else. Build-list item 6b.

This module is the reason the gateway is specified at all: it is v0.1 §5.5 for a network hop,
and **its asymmetry MUST NOT be inverted**. Only two kinds of observation assert that the
remote did nothing —

- the connection was never established, so no request byte can have been written;
- the peer said, in band and before dispatch, that it rejected the request;

— and everything else after the first byte is `AMBIGUOUS`. There is no option that relaxes
this, and adding one would remove the only guarantee this library makes.

Pure: it takes a description of what was observed and returns what to record and what to
send. No sockets, no store, no policy. The gateway's transport layer is responsible for
mapping its client's exceptions onto `Transport` honestly — in particular for using a fresh
connection per intercepted call, without which `NEVER_CONNECTED` is not provable (§6.8).

SPEC-v0.7 §2.1: the transport half of the rule lives in core, in `ctrlrun.transport`, and this
module calls it. `Transport` here **is** `ctrlrun.transport.Transport`, and what a transport
observation records is `ctrlrun.transport.effect_state`'s answer, looked up on that module at
call time. What stays here is MCP's: the JSON-RPC codes and tokens, the pre-dispatch set, the
observations of an upstream's answer, and the rule that a `401`, or a `403` carrying a
challenge, is `FAILED`. That last rule is the product's one path from an HTTP status to
`FAILED` (SPEC-v0.7 §2.4), and it rests on the MCP authorization specification putting the
token check before the method.
