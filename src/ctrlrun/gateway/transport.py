"""HTTP forwarding and incremental SSE decoding for the MCP gateway.

The listener supplies a request-local sink. Progress is sent immediately; an intercepted
final response is returned to Control first so its receipt exists before the client sees it.
The HTTP client is supplied lazily by server.py, keeping the gateway extra optional.

SPEC-v0.7 §2.5: the httpx variant of `ctrlrun.transport`'s classifier lives here, because httpx
does: `request()` is the gateway's rule offered to an executor that calls an HTTP API with httpx,
and `_observed` is the one mapping from an httpx exception to what was observed, called by
`request()` and by `HTTPForwarder`'s fresh path alike.
