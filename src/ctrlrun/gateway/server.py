"""The gateway's HTTP server. Build-list item 6c; SPEC-v0.2 §6.1, §6.3, §6.5-§6.8, §6.10.

An MCP client points here instead of at the tool server. `tools/call` becomes an Action -
decided, reserved, executed and recorded exactly as `@protect` does it — and every other
method is relayed unchanged. No agent changes.

The shape worth noticing is how §6.8 reaches the kernel. It is not a second outcome model:
the executor translates the table into v0.1 §5.5's own vocabulary — return for `COMMITTED`,
raise `NotExecuted` for `FAILED`, raise anything else for `AMBIGUOUS` — and `Control` then
applies the rules it has always applied. The gateway does not get its own way of deciding
what happened.
