"""The 2025 revisions' transport mechanics, relayed without being interpreted.

SPEC-v0.2 §6.2's passthrough table, and §6.2's one real cost: **resumption is not relayed for
an intercepted call**. A legacy stream may be resumed by a `GET` carrying `Last-Event-ID`,
which would let the final response to an intercepted `tools/call` arrive on a connection the
gateway is not attributing to that action — the outcome would land somewhere the gateway
cannot see, and the reservation would lease-expire into `AMBIGUOUS` despite a perfectly good
answer having been delivered.

So the gateway strips SSE `id:` fields from an intercepted response stream, making it
non-resumable for the client as it already is for the gateway. Non-intercepted streams are
relayed verbatim, `id:` fields included, because they carry no intercepted outcome.

    cannot wait for an event to end before deciding what to forward.
