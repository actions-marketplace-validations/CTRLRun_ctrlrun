"""Request parsing and header-body validation. Build-list item 6b; SPEC-v0.2 §6.2, §6.4, §6.6.

**The headers are checked; the body is believed.** The revision mirrors `method`,
`params.name` and annotated tool parameters into `Mcp-Method`, `Mcp-Name` and
`Mcp-Param-{Name}` so intermediaries can route without parsing bodies — and taking that
shortcut is exactly the hazard the mirroring rule exists to prevent, a load balancer routing
on the header while the server executes on the body. So the gateway parses every body it
forwards, validates every header against it, and decides what to intercept from the body.

Pure: bytes and headers in, a parsed request or a refusal out. No sockets and no store, so
§6.11's refusal table can be read against this module line by line.

    body already went through, so there is nothing to re-parse and nothing to be lenient about.

    This used to call `int(declared)`, which reads `2_000`, `+2000`, `02000`, ` 2000`, and the
    Arabic-indic and fullwidth spellings of 2000 as agreeing with a body carrying `2000`. None

    truth", so certifying agreement that only holds under Python's rules is the hazard rather
    than a convenience. Booleans were compared case-insensitively, with the same consequence.

    It also declines the revision's SHOULD that a server compare integers numerically, under
    which `2000.0` equals `2000`. v0.1 §2.3 refuses a float in the body outright (§6.6), so the
    leniency has no legitimate case here; taking it would mean accepting a spelling of a number
    that the body could never hold.

    Anything that is not a string, an integer or a boolean has **no** header encoding at all:
    the revision permits `x-mcp-header` only on those three, and says a `null` parameter omits
    its header entirely. So a header naming an argument of any other type cannot agree with it,
