"""What both servers in this package speak, and neither owns.

`ctrlrun gateway` (`server.py`) and `ctrlrun mcp-operator` (`operator.py`) are two HTTP servers
with the same response shape, the same JSON-RPC error shape and the same `--identity-jwt-*`
flags. The operator server was written second and reached into the gateway for all of it, and
the gateway then needed the operator's config type to say what `check_jwt_flags` accepts -- a
cycle, and a layering inversion: `ARCHITECTURE.md` §6 has dependencies pointing downward, and
the gateway has no business naming the operator even in a type annotation.

CodeQL's `py/unsafe-cyclic-import` found it, six times, before anyone read the diff that way.

So the shared half lives here, below both, and neither server imports the other. Nothing in this
module knows what a gateway or an operator console is: it is response bytes, JSON-RPC envelopes,
a case-insensitive header lookup, and the flag validation that has no safe default.
