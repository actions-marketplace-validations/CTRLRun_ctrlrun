"""Effect keys and effect records. Build-list items 5 and 6; SPEC-v0.1 §5.

The effect key is what duplicate protection is built on (§5.3): two attempts that resolve to
the same key are the same real-world effect, whatever their `action_id`s are. Resolution is
therefore strict — an unresolvable key is never a silent `None`, and a placeholder that
resolves to nothing identifiable is refused rather than rendered.

`plan_reservation` is the retry table of §5.4 as one pure function. Both StateStores decide
with it and then only write, so the rule that refuses a duplicate lives in exactly one place
and the in-memory store cannot drift into permitting what SQLite refuses.

The transitions of §5.2 are in `state.py`, where the records live. `ctrlrun resolve` — the
only way out of `AMBIGUOUS`, because it is the only one a human drives — arrives with item 8.

    A deterministic handle for reconciliation to observe **with**: an `AMBIGUOUS` effect can ask
    the provider "did this attempt happen?" by a key the provider already indexes, without a
    bespoke lookup per provider (§4.7). It gives nothing permission to act twice: after an
    ambiguous outcome the kernel still refuses a blind retry, and that is unchanged.

    Derived from `(effect_key, attempt)` and **never from the effect key alone** (§4.1). The
    effect key is stable across v0.1 §5.4's renewal, so a provider sent the key would answer the
    one retry the kernel permits *because the executor proved nothing happened* with the cached
    failure of the attempt that failed. A renewal is a new attempt and gets a new token; a repeat
    within one attempt, which is what provider-side deduplication is for, keeps the old one.

    The canonical input carries a versioned domain tag and goes through `canonical_bytes`, so two
    hosts agree byte for byte and the float rejection and the lone-surrogate refusal are inherited
    rather than re-argued (`v0.6 §6.2`). SHA-256, truncated to 16 octets and rendered as a UUID of
    **version 8**, because RFC 9562 puts a name-based UUID derived from SHA-256 in that space and
    not in version 5's. 36 characters fits every limit §1.3 checked, and the effect key itself
    does not appear in the token, which is what Stripe asks of callers whose keys are built from
    arguments that may identify a person.

    `attempt` must be an `int` that is not a `bool`, and at least 1. `canonical_bytes` accepts a
    `bool`, since `bool` subclasses `int` and JSON has `true`, so left to the canonicalizer
    `attempt=True` would derive a token nobody's attempt has: the check is here rather than
    inherited, and T235 is what keeps it load-bearing.

    An operator's effect key must name its effect uniquely across every store that shares one
    provider account (§4.6): two stores deriving one key string for two different effects would
    have the provider deduplicate the second against the first, and the kernel, which sees one
    store, cannot check that.
