"""JWT verification as an `IdentityProvider`. Build-list item 5; SPEC-v0.3 §3.4.

Ships in `ctrlrun[identity]` and is imported by naming it: `import ctrlrun` must not pull in
`jwt` (§1.1, T92). The dependency is resolved at construction, so an operator who has not
installed the extra gets `MissingDependency` naming the install command rather than a
`ModuleNotFoundError` from halfway down an import chain.

**ctrlrun consumes identities; it issues none.** This is not an OAuth client. It performs no
authorization-code flow, no refresh, no token exchange, no introspection and no dynamic client
registration. It verifies a token somebody else obtained and maps the verified claims onto a
`Principal`. Everything beyond verification belongs to the deployment.

Two things it deliberately cannot do, stated here rather than discovered later (§3.4):

- **A tenant-templated issuer cannot be configured correctly.** `issuer` is an exact string.
  Pointing it at a multi-tenant endpoint without pinning the tenant makes every tenant on that
  platform a valid issuer for this process, and that is the fail-open direction.
- **A verified token can be revoked before its `exp`** (SPEC-v0.8 §6), and a token without an
  `exp` is still refused. Pass `revocations=` a `ctrlrun.revocation.RevocationFeed` and a
  credential the issuer has revoked is refused here, at resolution, as `IdentityError`. Without
  one this is 0.7.0 exactly: short lifetimes are then the whole of the story.

  **Nothing subscribes and nothing introspects.** A subscription needs an endpoint this project
  serves and an introspection call is a question this project asks nobody; `PollingRevocationFeed`
  polls, and `FileRevocationFeed` reads what the operator's own transmitter wrote. Consuming an
  event is reading it (`v0.3 §1.1`).

  **A revoked credential leaves a log line and no receipt** (§6.4). `resolve` runs before an
  `Action` exists, so there is no `action_id` to attribute a refusal to. An *expired* credential
  is different: it is checked on `action.principal` inside `execute`, where one does, and it
  produces an `ACTION_DENIED` event and a `DENIED` receipt. The asymmetry is deliberate.
