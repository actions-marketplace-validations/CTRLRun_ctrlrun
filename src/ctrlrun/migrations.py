"""Schema version and the forward-only migration runner. Build-list item 2; SPEC-v0.6 §3.

Six places across v0.2, v0.3, v0.4 and v0.5 say *"there is still no migration story -- that is
v0.6."* This is it.

**A schema version nobody checks is a schema version that lies.** From v0.6 a store refuses a
database it does not recognise, in **both** directions: a newer binary migrates or refuses, and an
**older** binary against a newer schema refuses immediately rather than reading columns it does
not understand. The second direction is the one that gets forgotten and the one that corrupts --
a binary that reads a table it half understands does not fail, it succeeds, silently dropping the
columns it does not know.

**The backward guard begins with v0.6, and that qualifier is not a detail.** A released v0.5
binary has no version check at all: it will open a v0.6 database and `SELECT json FROM receipts`
straight past `seq`, `prev_hash` and `hash`. So the rule protects a v0.6-or-later reader from a
future schema; it cannot protect a reader that shipped before it existed. `SPEC-v0.6 §9.5` states
the operational consequence -- **upgrade every reader before upgrading any writer** -- and this
paragraph exists so the module does not imply a protection it cannot give retroactively.

**The version is recorded, never inferred.** A store MUST NOT decide what version a database is by
looking for a column: `PRAGMA table_info` answers *what is there*, which is not the same question
as *what has been applied*, and the two diverge the moment a migration does anything a column list
cannot show -- a backfill, a constraint, a data repair.

**Forward-only.** A downgrade that has never been run against a real database is a button that
does not work, and it will be found out on the worst day. The supported way back is the backup
taken before the upgrade.

This module lives beside `state.py` rather than above it: it is what decides whether a store may
open, and a store whose admission check lived somewhere else would be a store with two front
doors.
