"""`ctrlrun scan` — what a project is not covering. `docs/SPEC-scan.md`.

Scan reads text. It reports the consequential call sites and policy entries ctrlrun is not
covering, so that an operator can see the gap between *installed* and *in the path*. It is a
finder and not a proof: §4 of the specification enumerates what it misses by construction, and
`report_lines` prints that on every run, including the run with no findings.

Three rules shape everything here.

**It never imports the tree it reads** (§2.1). `ast.parse` on the file's bytes and nothing
else. Importing a module executes it at module scope, and a tool whose purpose is to find calls
that move money must not be the thing that makes one.

**It adds no entry point** (§9.2). No `Action` is built, no `Principal` resolved, no `Control`
constructed and no store opened. The tempting version of this tool asks the policy what would
happen to each call site it finds, and a principal invented by a tool from a source file is
`--principal-from-client-info` in a fourth costume.

**Where it does not know, it says so** (§7). A file that will not parse and a call with no
resolvable name are counted and printed, never skipped: the file scan cannot read is exactly
where something would hide.

This module sits above `control.py`, beside `verify/` and `cli/`. Nothing in the kernel imports
it and `import ctrlrun` must not reach it (T206).
