"""The adapter surface. Build-list item 2; SPEC-v0.5 §2, §3.

An adapter exists for exactly one reason: **to route an `APPROVE` through a framework's own
interrupt instead of raising past it**. `@protect` already covers anything running in this
process and the gateway covers anything reaching its tools over MCP, so a framework with no
human-in-the-loop primitive of its own has nothing for an adapter to reuse and does not need
one.

Three things make that one reason safe to hand to somebody else.

**A Protocol, not a base class.** A base class is a channel for the kernel to change an
adapter's behaviour later without its author's consent: a method added with a default runs in
every adapter that inherited it, at the next upgrade, in a distribution the kernel does not
version. A Protocol cannot do that, and this is one of the six contracts v1.0 freezes.

**One place the grant is written, and it is not the adapter.** `InterruptApprovalProvider` calls
the same `grant_approval`/`deny_approval` that `ctrlrun approve` and the webhook call. An
adapter returns an answer; it never records one. That is what makes "never a second approval
path" structural rather than advisory -- no adapter can grow one by accident, by copy-paste, or
by an author who read the rule and forgot it.

**The principal is seen and never supplied.** `needs_approval` is here, in core, rather than in
each adapter, because an adapter that built an `Action` for its framework's pre-invocation
predicate would need a `Principal` -- and a self-asserted one is `--principal-from-client-info`,
which SPEC-v0.3 §8.1 removed from the gateway by name and §8.4 then removed again from the ACS
hook. It reached this document's first draft as well, and an independent review found it; SPEC-v0.5
§9.1 is the record.

This module imports `action.py`, `approval.py`, `effect.py` and `errors.py`, and two names
from `policy.py`: `OBSERVE`, which is the mode the banner reads, and `Decision`, which is the
vocabulary the predicate answers in. Neither is the evaluator, which is what the module map
means by policy internals. `Control` arrives as a *parameter*, never as a module-scope
import, so `adapter.py` stays below `control.py` in the dependency order of
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §6 and `Control` remains the only module that composes the others. It
appends no event and owns no sink.

    """Does this call need a human? For a framework that asks before it invokes (SPEC-v0.5 §3.5).

    The OpenAI Agents SDK's shape: the framework asks whether a tool call needs approval
    *before* it invokes the tool, surfaces its own approval item, and invokes only after a human
    answers. This answers that question and nothing else -- `True` iff the combined
    SPEC-v0.3 §4.6 decision is `APPROVE`.

    It is core's rather than each adapter's because the only way to write it in an adapter was
    to build an `Action`, and `Action.principal` has no default: the principal would have come
    from the framework's session, which is the one thing §4.2 forbids. Here it comes from
    `Control.resolve_principal`, exactly as it does at every other entry point.

    **It writes nothing**: no event, no receipt, no request, no reservation. A framework may
    call its predicate more than once, and a predicate that left evidence behind would put a
    proposal in the log for every time the framework wondered.

    A `DENY` returns `False`, so the tool is invoked and `Control.execute` denies it with a
    receipt, an `ACTION_DENIED` and the exception the caller catches. Refusing here would refuse
    without evidence, and SPEC-v0.3 §4.3 is explicit that a denial with a principal to attribute
    it to belongs in the evidence log.

    `resource` is a template over `arguments`, as `@protect`'s is (v0.1 §5.1), and the policy's
    `resource:` is used where none is given -- the same precedence `@protect` applies. It
    matters: authority matches on resource patterns (SPEC-v0.3 §4.2), so a predicate that
    skipped it would evaluate a different action from the one that runs.

    `task` and `hop` are that same argument one frame further out (SPEC-v0.10 §9). Without them
    this predicate evaluates against the receiver's **whole candidate set** while `execute`
    evaluates against the hop **alone** (§2.3), so it answers "no human needed" for a call
    `execute` then refuses. That is not a wider grant -- `Control.execute` is the enforcement
    point and decides against the hop either way -- but it costs the framework its own approval
