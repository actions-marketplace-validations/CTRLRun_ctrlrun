"""The report and its three renderings. SPEC-v0.4 §4.

`run()` performs the work and returns a `Report`; rendering it costs nothing and can be done
more than once. `exit_code` lives here rather than in the CLI so §4.4 has one implementation,
and so a caller embedding verify in their own tool reaches the same answer the command does.

Every enum renders **by value** (§4, T117), which is `v0.1 §6.1`'s rule applied to a new
document: evidence has to be readable by something that never imported ctrlrun.
