"""`ctrlrun verify` — the operator's own configuration, against the kernel's own refusals.

SPEC-v0.4 §1, §9.1. Core: stdlib, `pyyaml` and `click`, and **not** re-exported from
`ctrlrun`. A verification tool behind an extra is one half the deployments never run, so this
is not optional; but it is an operator's tool and not part of the action path, so `import
ctrlrun` must not import it and nothing in the kernel may come to depend on it (T125b).

`verify/` sits **above** `control.py`, beside `cli/`: it composes `Control`, `Policy` and
`Authority` the way an application does, and it proposes no action of its own — it drives the
entry points `v0.3 §4.3.1` already enumerates and asserts that each applies the checks that
table requires (§3.9).

There is **no flag that relaxes a check**. No argument, no environment variable, nothing that
makes verify's `Control` behave differently from the operator's. The moment one exists, the
thing being verified is not the thing that ships.

    report, so a run that passed every applicable guarantee opened with

    provokes is deliberate; the report is where it says so.
