"""Deriving scenarios from a configuration, and running them. SPEC-v0.4 §3.

Everything here is derived from the two documents verify reads. There is **no randomness** —
not seeded randomness, none: selection is sorted by codepoint, values come from a fixed table,
and two runs against one document choose the same actions with the same arguments (§3.2, T105).

Three rules this module is written against, and each has a place below where it would be easy
to break:

- **N/A is a statement about the document.** A guarantee whose scenario cannot be built from
  the configuration is `not_applicable` with the reason from §2.2. A scenario that could not be
  built for any other cause — a synthesized vector landing in the wrong rule, a store that
  would not open — is an internal error and exits 3 (§3.8). The two are never conflated.
- **Verify never touches the operator's store.** Every scenario runs against a scratch store in
  a temporary directory removed when the run ends. `state_path()` is never called and
  `Control.from_file()` is never used (§3.5, T103).
- **Every guarantee carries a positive control.** A refusal asserted against a scenario in
  which nothing ran passes on a kernel with the guard deleted, so each scenario establishes
  that the observable would have been visible had the guard not fired. A control that does not
  behave as specified is `fail` with `reason: "control failed"` — never a pass, never an N/A
  (§1.3, T125).

        terminal outcome, a denial included. The one N/A left is a policy with no actions in it,

        `ctrlrun receipts --verify-chain` is the one that reads the
        operator's own store, and §6.6 keeps the two apart.

        Two halves, and the second is `v0.4 §1.3`'s required positive control. **Without it a
        kernel whose detector returned "broken" unconditionally would pass**, which is this
        project's oldest false green.

        The alteration is applied to the receipts as read back, not by an `UPDATE`: verify does
        not know what backend it is on and may not assume one it can write SQL against. What it
        checks is therefore the detector and the chain the store actually wrote -- a store that

        **Observable.** A listener verify bound reads at least one request byte and resets. The
        executor drives `ctrlrun.transport.HTTPConnection("127.0.0.1", port)` directly, not
        `urlopen`, which honours `HTTP_PROXY` and on a host that sets one would send the request
        somewhere else. The byte's arrival is asserted first: without it, "not `NotExecuted`"
        would be true of a request that never left. Then: the exception is not `NotExecuted`, the
        receipt is `ambiguous`, and where there is a key the record is `AMBIGUOUS`.

        **Three more observable rows**, each where a different wrong classifier is wrong, because
        the reset row fails in `getresponse()` and a claim can only originate in `connect()`: a
        classifier with no evidence at all passes it (§12.2.11).

        - *read timeout*: the listener reads the request and never answers. A classifier that
          maps `TimeoutError` to `NotExecuted` claims here.
        - *reused*: one connection delivers a request and is answered; the listener is gone, its
          port held by a socket that does not listen; the same connection's next request
          reconnects and fails. A classifier that ignores the connection's own byte mark claims.
        - *second connection*: one connection delivers a request and is answered; a second,
          separate connection in the same executor run fails to connect. A classifier that judges
          each connection alone, with no register of the run, claims.

        Each asserts first that its listener received a request byte, then that the answer is not
        `NotExecuted`, the receipt `ambiguous` and the record `AMBIGUOUS`.

        **Control.** A socket verify bound and never listened on: the call raises `NotExecuted`
        chained from the connect's own exception, a refusal on Linux and a timeout on macOS, the
        receipt is `failed`, the record `FAILED`. A classifier that never claimed would pass the
        observable rows and fail this; one that claimed where it should not fails one of them.
        Every row uses its own effect key, so each is a first attempt.

        `N/A` only where no action can be driven to `allow` or `approve`, with `unselected()`'s
        reason, as G10's. Never because of the environment: a machine that will not let verify bind
        or reach its own loopback listener is an internal error, exit 3.

    def g13(self) -> GuaranteeResult:
        """SPEC-v0.7 §8.9. Graded against `--store-url postgresql://…`, `N/A` otherwise.

        **Aligned, not the raw clock.** The host running verify is often a CI runner and not the
        operator's production host, so the control is a store whose application clock is aligned
        with the server's by the offset a first measurement found. A verify that failed because
        a runner's clock drifted would be grading the wrong machine.

        **Sized against the bound, never fixed.** A conforming store reports only past
        `threshold + bound`, and the bound is half the round trip to the store, so an injection
        of a fixed size grades the link on a slow one: a correct store stays silent and a fixed
        margin calls that silence a defect. The injection is widened from the bound the shifted
        store measured until a conforming store would have to report it, and a report on the
        aligned clock that the aligning measurement's own doubt could explain is met by aligning
        again rather than by a FAIL. A link verify cannot outrun in `_SKEW_ATTEMPTS` is
        **verify's own internal error**, exit 3 (`v0.4 §3.8`): a fact about the machine and the
        network, never a verdict on the kernel.

        The action is one no document names, so the policy denies it (`unknown_action`) and the
        guarantee needs nothing from the document but the store: the report under test is taken
        at the start of `execute`, before any decision, and a denial reaches it as surely as an
        allow. Every store here is a scratch schema verify made and drops (SPEC-v0.6 §4.1).

        Both halves are asserted, `v0.4 §1.3`'s rule: a detector that always fires fails the
        control, one that never fires fails the observable, and one that never runs fails the
        control, because the measurement must be present.

        attempts, which §5.5's fast path alone refuses, so G15 passed with the check on the
        assigned attempt number deleted: green with the guarantee's own mechanism gone. This
        drives §5.5's public route instead. Attempt N ends `AMBIGUOUS` through a `TimeoutError`,
        so the fast path reads a record that is not `FAILED` and lets the call through; attempt
        N+1's `reconcile` hook answers `not_executed`, the record moves to `FAILED` at N, the
        second take renews it to N+1, and only the check after the reservation can refuse that.

        **The control is that every attempt up to N executed**, so for N of 2 or more a kernel
        that refused every renewal fails here. At N = 1 there is no renewal to admit and the

    # --- G31: one chain, five receipt schema versions, walked end to end ------------------

    def g31(self) -> GuaranteeResult:
        """SPEC-v0.11 §6, §8. A chain spanning five receipt schema versions verifies end to end.

        **The walk, not the field.** `schema` has existed since `SPEC-v0.3.md` §12.2 and v0.11
        adds no field. What was never proved is that `verify_chain` walks a chain holding more
        than one of them, hash by hash, **each row hashed by the rule its own version wrote**.
        v0.10's release pass proved the `v6`/`v7` boundary against the released 0.9.0 and stopped
        there.

        **Why this can be graded without installing five wheels**, which is the question to ask
        of a scenario about released versions. `SPEC-v0.7.md` §6.11 made `to_dict` render under
        *its own* schema's label and key set, and made a receipt hash the document it was read
        from, through the same `_document_hash` every version has used. So a `Receipt` carrying
        `ctrlrun.receipt/v3` serializes to v3's 26 keys and hashes to what 0.6 stored.

        **It cannot go through `put_receipt`, and that is correct.** Every backend's
        `put_receipt` does `replace(receipt, schema=RECEIPT_SCHEMA, ...)`: a writer writes under
        its own schema, so an older receipt cannot be forged through the public API. The first
        version of this scenario tried exactly that and control 1 below caught it, reporting a
        chain of one label where it had asked for five. So the chain is presented as a
        `ChainSource` **view**, which is what `G11` already does to alter a row, and the links
        are computed the way `put_receipt` computes them: `seq` and `prev_hash` into the
        document, then `_document_hash` over it, then that digest is the next row's `prev_hash`.

        **The construction is self-checking.** If it were wrong, `verify_chain` would report
        breaks and this scenario would fail rather than pass: there is no way for a badly built
        chain to grade `PASS` here. What that does not cover is a walk that quietly skipped rows
        whose label it did not recognise, so there are two controls, and neither is decoration:

        1. The chain must really hold **five distinct schema labels** before the walk is graded.
           A chain of five `v7` rows verifies perfectly and proves nothing, which is
           `SPEC-v0.4.md` §2.2's guarantee that could not have failed.
        2. An **older** row is then altered and the break must be named at its `seq`. Without it
           "verified" would be a count of the rows the walk bothered to read.

        `scripts/five_schema_chain.py` is the other half, and it is the one built from the
        **released wheels**: five environments, five `pip install ctrlrun==`, one real store.
        This guarantee is what an operator can run on their own host with no network; that
        script is what proves the premise against what 0.6 actually wrote.
