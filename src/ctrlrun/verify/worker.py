"""G4's process target. SPEC-v0.4 §2.2, §3.6.

A module-level function taking one picklable argument — a JSON string — because a bound method
over a `Control` is not picklable and `spawn` is the default start method on macOS and Windows.
The child rebuilds the whole composition from paths and plain strings: the same policy
document, the same authority document, a `SQLiteStateStore` on the same scratch file.

It is reached as `python -m ctrlrun.verify.worker`, with the payload on stdin, rather than
through `multiprocessing.Process`. `spawn` re-imports the parent's `__main__` module in every
child, so a caller who ran `ctrlrun.verify.run()` from an unguarded script would fork-bomb
itself — and "put your call under `if __name__ == '__main__'`" is not a requirement a
verification tool gets to impose on the program it is verifying. These are the same eight OS
processes either way, which is the whole of what the guarantee is about.

The children run under the **real** clock. §2.2 says why: a callable is not picklable, and
timing is not what G4 is about — atomicity across processes is. Every other scenario uses the
injected clock of §3.6.

Nothing here opens a socket, and nothing here imports the operator's code (§1.2, §3.7).
