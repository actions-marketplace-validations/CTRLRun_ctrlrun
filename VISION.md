# VISION.md

> **This is not a build spec, and it is not the state of the code.** It was written before v0.1 shipped, so that the long-term shape is written down once and stops leaking into READMEs, schemas, and PRs. What has actually shipped is in [`https://ctrlrun.dev/docs/ROADMAP`](https://ctrlrun.dev/docs/ROADMAP) and in each version's `docs/SPEC-v0.x.md`; where a section below has since been built, a *Status* line says which version built it and where it differs from the sketch. Everything without one is still a sketch, and nothing here is a commitment. Do not derive tasks from this file.

## 1. Thesis

Companies grant authority to humans, applications, and services. AI agents and autonomous workflows are joining that list. They will send, pay, refund, delete, deploy, grant, revoke, approve, submit, purchase, and cancel.

That creates a new infrastructure question:

**How much authority should a machine have over each consequential action — and how do we enforce it, prove it, and recover when execution goes wrong?**

ctrlrun is the enforcement infrastructure between **intention** and **consequence**. Not between prompt and model.

## 2. Two concentric circles

**Circle 1 — the wedge.** Agent executes payment → response lost → agent retries → ctrlrun refuses the blind retry. Narrow. Instantly understood. This is v0.1.

**Circle 2 — the product.** Action-level autonomy infrastructure: for each action, is it authorized, how much autonomy, is approval needed, was *this* action approved, is execution safe, did it already happen, what was the outcome. This is v0.2–v0.5.

ctrlrun is consequence-specific, not industry-specific. If an agent only reads, searches, summarizes, or answers, ctrlrun is low value. It earns its place where an agent has write access to the real world.

## 3. End-state architecture

          ▼
       RECEIPT → EVIDENCE HISTORY
```

The hard center, which must remain true however the ecosystem evolves: **exact identity → exact approval → effect key → reservation → COMMITTED/FAILED/AMBIGUOUS → no blind retry.** If this kernel is mediocre, nothing built on top of it matters.

## 4. Product surfaces (modules, not brands)

| Surface | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Kernel | Action-level authorization and execution semantics (OSS, never crippled) |
| Gateway | Protect existing MCP/API/tool servers with no agent changes |
| Authority | Delegated machine authority, constraints, attenuation |
| Oversight | Approval workflows: roles, M-of-N, sequential, escalation, separation of duties, break-glass |
| Evidence | Receipts, event ledger, verification, exports (OTel, SIEM) |

## 5. Candidate models (sketched before they were built; expect the rest to change on contact with users)

**Authority grant**
```yaml
subject: { agent: refund-agent }
permissions: [stripe.refund]
resources: ["merchant:EU-42"]
constraints: { amount_lte: 5000, currency: [EUR] }
environment: [production]
expires_at: 2026-10-01T18:00:00Z
```
Delegation attenuates, never amplifies: `child ⊆ parent`. Human €100k → finance agent €25k → support agent €2k. A request beyond the chain → DENY, "authority escalation".

*Status: built in v0.3 (`docs/SPEC-v0.3.md`), and `ctrlrun demo`'s fifth scenario is this chain. Subjects address `agent` and `user`, never a claim; omission never means unlimited; authority is opt-in and then fail-closed.*

**Resource / data scope** — permission over *which* records, not just *which* tool: assigned cases only, permitted data categories, purpose, expiry. This is what makes healthcare, legal, and government workable.

*Status: resource patterns shipped with v0.3; the data-scope primitive is v0.6 (`docs/SPEC-v0.6.md`).*

**Consequence taxonomy (candidate)** — OBSERVE · COMMUNICATE · DATA_ACCESS · DATA_DISCLOSURE · DATA_MUTATION · FINANCIAL_EFFECT · PRIVILEGE_CHANGE · ELIGIBILITY_EFFECT · LEGAL_EFFECT · OPERATIONAL_EFFECT · SAFETY_CRITICAL_EFFECT · DESTRUCTIVE_EFFECT. Enables defaults per class. Twelve is probably too many; users will tell us.

*Status: not built, and on every milestone's do-not-build list so far. A policy names actions, not classes.*

**Control registry** — a named organizational reason for a restriction (owner, applies-to consequence, required decision, approver role, version). Receipts reference it, so an auditor can trace *requirement → policy → action → enforcement → oversight → execution → evidence*.

*Status: v0.6, as the kernel-side object a sector pack configures.*

**Recovery** — declarative per-action `on_ambiguous: reconcile` / `on_failure: compensate`. ctrlrun coordinates safety semantics; it never becomes the workflow scheduler. Integrate with Temporal-class runtimes; don't recreate them.

*Status: reconciliation shipped in v0.2 as a hook that resolves an `AMBIGUOUS` effect, and `ctrlrun resolve` is the human path. Compensation and sagas are not built and are on the do-not-build list.*

**Verify** — `ctrlrun verify` runs deterministic adversarial scenarios against a real configuration and reports per-guarantee pass/fail with counterexamples. Badge means "declared guarantees pass", never "secure".

*Status: built in v0.4 (`docs/SPEC-v0.4.md`, `https://ctrlrun.dev/docs/verify`). One thing the sketch did not have: a guarantee the configuration cannot exercise reports `not_applicable` with a reason, and not applicable is not a pass.*

## 6. Standards posture

Align, don't invent: OWASP ACS, MCP, A2A, OAuth, OpenTelemetry, and NIST agent identity work. Only define semantics that don't already exist elsewhere — effect states and exact-action binding qualify; identity and tracing don't. Never claim compliance: a standard appears in a mapping doc only after code touches it and a test proves the guarantee.

## 7. Sector packs (templates, not engines)

**Templates (shipped in v0.2, `examples/policies/`).** A starting-point `ctrlrun.yaml` per sector, written against v0.1 primitives only: devops (prod deploy, DB mutation, deletion) · payments (refund authority, limits) · e-commerce (orders, cancellations, price changes) · insurance (claim authority, payout limits, eligibility) · healthcare (PHI disclosure, data scope, case assignment) · legal (privileged documents, external disclosure, filing/settlement authority) · security (grant/revoke, credentials, isolation) · government (benefits, records, permits) · hr (offers, terminations, compensation changes). Each says on its face that it is a starting point to be adapted, not a configuration to adopt.

**Full depth (a content track, after v0.6).** The same nine sectors, each with a control registry, approver roles, data scope, consequence defaults, and worked examples. It waits on v0.6 because that is where the control registry and data-scope primitives land, and a pack should be configuration rather than code; it waits on nothing else. Packs are released individually as `packs/<sector>/` under their own version tags — `packs-payments-1.0` and so on — never sharing a version with the kernel, never gating a kernel release and never gated by one. Kernel versions ship correctness; content ships on its own cadence.

Each pack is authored in one AI session and reviewed in a separate AI session that did not author it, against cited public sources — PCI DSS, PSD2, the HIPAA Security Rule, SOX/COSO and maker-checker guidance, ABA Model Rules, NIST SP 800-53, CIS benchmarks, records-management and employment-law basics. The review ships with the pack as `REVIEW.md`, listing every control, the source clause it derives from, and every gap found; unresolved gaps stay listed rather than being quietly closed. A pack states that it was authored and reviewed by AI against those sources, and never describes itself as compliant with any regulation. That is a claim only an accountable human reviewer can make, and ctrlrun does not make it on anyone's behalf.

Same kernel, different `ctrlrun.yaml` and control registries.

## 8. What we will never build

LLM hosting · model routing · RAG · vector DB · agent memory · prompt management · agent builder UI · full IAM · SIEM · generic observability · general workflow engine · secrets manager · generic sandbox · generic DLP · agent marketplace · prompt firewall.

Owning consequential agent execution means building everything necessary for that. Not everything adjacent to AI agents.

## 9. How this file is used

- Opened for the first time at v0.3 planning.
- Never cited in a PR description as justification for scope.
- Rewritten only when users contradict it.
