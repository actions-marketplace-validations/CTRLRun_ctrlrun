"""Turn the attestation `actions/attest-build-provenance` produced into release assets.

The action signs the distributions and hands back one Sigstore bundle. That bundle lives in
the runner's temp directory and in GitHub's attestation store, neither of which is a file
anybody downloading a release can see. This writes two, beside the distributions, so that
`gh release create dist/*` carries them:

  <name>.intoto.jsonl    the DSSE envelopes, one per line -- the SLSA convention, and what a
                         provenance scanner reads
  <name>.sigstore.json   the bundle verbatim -- what `gh attestation verify --bundle` reads
                         without going back to GitHub

And, before either is written, it checks the thing that actually matters: that the statement
is about **these** bytes. An attestation whose subjects are not the artifacts being uploaded
is worse than no attestation at all, because it passes every check that looks for a file and
none that looks inside it. Mismatch is a non-zero exit and nothing on disk.
