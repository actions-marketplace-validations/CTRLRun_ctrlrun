"""The invariants the fuzz targets assert, and the decoders that turn bytes into inputs.

**No Atheris import lives here on purpose.** Atheris is one driver for these properties and
`tests/test_fuzzing.py` is another, so they run on every commit whether or not anybody has a
fuzzing toolchain -- and a contributor can reproduce a finding with nothing but the standard
library. `fuzz/fuzz_*.py` are the Atheris entry points and contain no assertions of their own.

Two properties, chosen because each is a promise the project has written down:

* **Canonicalization** (`v0.1 §2.3`, which calls it security-critical).
  Two distinct actions sharing a canonical form share an approval, and nothing in a receipt
  would look wrong. This repository has already had one such bug -- `str(key)` folding `{"1":
  "a", 1: "b"}` into a single key, with the survivor decided by insertion order -- and a review
  found it. These are the properties that would have found it without one.

* **`Policy.from_yaml`**, whose docstring says "anything malformed raises `PolicyError`". That
  is the fail-closed rule in one sentence. A loader raising `KeyError` still denies, but through
  a crash nobody classified, and a caller catching `PolicyError` would not catch it.

# --- known findings ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: Findings that are real, reported, and not yet fixed -- recorded here rather than worked
#: around in the decoder, because a fuzzer whose corpus is pruned to avoid its own findings
#: reports zero forever.
#:
#: **Empty, and the machinery stays.** It held `lone-surrogate-in-a-string` --
#: `canonical_bytes` raising `UnicodeEncodeError` instead of `InvalidArgument` for an unpaired
#: UTF-16 surrogate -- until that was fixed in `action.py`. The entry's own test asserted the
#: finding *still reproduced*, so the fix turned it red and the entry had to go. That is the
#: mechanism working, and it is why the dict is left in place for the next one.
#:
#: `test_the_seed_corpus_reproduces_every_known_finding` compares this to what the corpus
#: actually produces, in both directions, so an entry cannot be added without a reproducer and
#: a reproducer cannot start failing unnoticed.
